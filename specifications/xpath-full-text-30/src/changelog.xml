<td>Re: Bug 2299: Changes to Section 4</td>
<td>The AllMatches model has been changed to allow the TokenInfo of a StringMatch to represent an interval of token positions, instead of single positions. Thus, a phrase is now modeled using a single StringMatch, and consequently distance constraints (which always apply to the individual StringMatches) can be used to constrain the entire phrase. In addition, this change allows to model overlapping tokens. The semantics functions for FTOrder (order now constrains the start positions of tokens), for FTScope, for FTDistance (a distance constraint requires a certain number of positions between the end of one token and the start of the next) and for FTWindows have been adapted.</td>
