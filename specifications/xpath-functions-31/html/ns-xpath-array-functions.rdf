         Returns an array containing all the members of a supplied array, plus one additional member at the end.
      filterfilter(array(*), function(item()*) as xs:boolean) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing those members of the $array for which 
            $function returns true.
      flattenflatten(item()*) as item()*
         Replaces any array appearing in a supplied sequence with the members of the array, recursively.
      fold-leftfold-left(array(*), item()*, function(item()*, item()*) as item()*) as item()*
         Evaluates the supplied function cumulatively on successive members of the supplied
            array.
      fold-rightfold-right(array(*), item()*, function(item()*, item()*) as item()*) as item()*
         Evaluates the supplied function cumulatively on successive values of the supplied
            array.
      for-eachfor-each(array(*), function(item()*) as item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array whose size is the same as array:size($array), in which
            each member is computed by applying $function to the corresponding member of
            $array.
      for-each-pairfor-each-pair(array(*), array(*), function(item()*, item()*) as item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array obtained by evaluating the supplied function once for each pair of members at the same position in
            the two supplied arrays.
      getget(array(*), xs:integer) as item()*
         Returns the value at the specified position in the supplied array (counting from 1).
      headhead(array(*)) as item()*
         Returns the first member of an array, that is $array(1).
      insert-beforeinsert-before(array(*), xs:integer, item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of the supplied array, with one additional member at a specified position.
      joinjoin(array(*)*) as array(*)
         Concatenates the contents of several arrays into a single array.
      putput(array(*), xs:integer, item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of a supplied array, except for one member which is replaced with a new value.
      removeremove(array(*), xs:integer*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of the supplied array, except for the members at specified positions.
      reversereverse(array(*)) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of a supplied array, but in reverse order.
      sizesize(array(*)) as xs:integer
         Returns the number of members in the supplied array.
      sortsort(array(*)) as array(*)sort(array(*), xs:string?) as array(*)sort(array(*), xs:string?, function(item()*) as xs:anyAtomicType*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of the supplied array, sorted 
            according to the value of a sort key supplied as a function.
      subarraysubarray(array(*), xs:integer) as array(*)subarray(array(*), xs:integer, xs:integer) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all members from a supplied array starting at a supplied
            position, up to a specified length.
      tailtail(array(*)) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all members except the first from a supplied array.
