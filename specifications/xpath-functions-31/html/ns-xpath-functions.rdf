            in this specification, into a string conforming to the JSON grammar.
      putput(node(), xs:string) as empty-sequence()Stores a document or element to the location specified by $uri. This function is normally invoked to create a resource 
          on an external storage system such as a file system or a database.The external effects of fn:put are implementation-defined, since they occur outside the domain of XQuery. 
            The intent is that, if fn:put is invoked on a document node and no error is raised, a subsequent query can access 
            the stored document by invoking fn:doc with the same URI.XQuery and XPath Functions and Operators 3.1
