                XPath 3.1, XQuery 3.1, and XSLT 3.0 (at the time of writing, XSLT 3.0 requires support for
                version 3.0 of this specification, and makes support for version 3.1 optional). 
                The exact syntax used to call these
                functions and operators is specified in <bibref ref="xpath-31"/>, <bibref ref="xquery-31"/> and 
            <bibref ref="xslt-30"/>. </p><p>This document defines three classes of functions:</p><ulist><item><p>General purpose functions, available for direct use in user-written queries, stylesheets, and XPath expressions,
               whose arguments and results are values defined by the <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"/>.</p></item><item><p>Constructor functions, used for creating instances of a datatype from values of (in general) a different
            datatype. These functions are also available for general use; they are named after the datatype that they return,
            and they always take a single argument.</p></item><item><p>Functions that specify the semantics of operators defined in <bibref ref="xpath-31"/> and <bibref ref="xquery-31"/>.
            These exist for specification purposes only, and are not intended for direct calling from user-written code.</p></item></ulist><p>
                <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> defines a number of primitive and derived datatypes,
                collectively known as built-in datatypes. This document defines functions and
                operations on these datatypes as well as the other types 
                (for example, nodes and sequences of nodes) defined in <xspecref spec="DM31" ref="types"/> of 
            the <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"/>.
                These functions and operations are available for use in <bibref ref="xpath-31"/>,
                    <bibref ref="xquery-31"/> and any other host language that chooses to reference them.
                In particular, they may be referenced in future versions of XSLT and related XML standards. </p><p><bibref ref="xmlschema11-2"/> adds to the datatypes defined
            in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. It introduces a new derived type <code>xs:dateTimeStamp</code>, and it
         incorporates as built-in types the two types <code>xs:yearMonthDuration</code> and <code>xs:dayTimeDuration</code>
         which were previously XDM additions to the type system. In addition, XSD 1.1 clarifies and updates many
         aspects of the definitions of the existing datatypes: for example, it extends the value space of
         <code>xs:double</code> to allow both positive and negative zero, and extends the lexical space to allow <code>+INF</code>;
            it modifies the value space of <code>xs:Name</code>
         to permit additional Unicode characters; it allows year zero and disallows leap seconds in <code>xs:dateTime</code>
         values; and it allows any character string to appear as the value of an <code>xs:anyURI</code> item.
         Implementations of this specification <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> support either XSD 1.0 or XSD 1.1 or both.</p><p>References to specific sections of some of the above documents are indicated by
                cross-document links in this document. Each such link consists of a pointer to a
                specific section followed a superscript specifying the linked document. The

               This recommendation contains a set of function specifications. 
               It defines conformance at the level of individual functions. An implementation of a function conforms to a function specification 
               in this recommendation if all the following conditions are satisfied:</p><ulist><item><p>For all combinations of valid inputs to the function (both explicit arguments and implicit context dependencies), 
                  the result of the function meets the mandatory requirements of this specification.
               </p></item><item><p>For all invalid inputs to the function, the implementation signals (in some way appropriate to the calling environment) that a dynamic error has occurred.
               </p></item><item><p>For a sequence of calls within the same <termref def="execution-scope">execution scope</termref>, the requirements of this recommendation 
                  regarding the <termref def="dt-deterministic">determinism</termref> of results are satisfied (see <specref ref="properties-of-functions"/>).
               </p></item></ulist><p>Other recommendations ("host languages") that reference this document may dictate:</p><ulist><item><p>Subsets or supersets of this set of functions to be available in particular environments;</p></item><item><p>Mechanisms for invoking functions, supplying arguments, initializing the static and dynamic context, receiving results, and handling errors;
               </p></item><item><p>A concrete realization of concepts such as <termref def="execution-scope">execution scope</termref>;</p></item><item><p>Which versions of other specifications referenced herein (for example, XML, XSD, or Unicode) are to be used.</p></item></ulist><p>Any behavior that is discretionary (implementation-defined or implementation-dependent) in this specification may be constrained by a host language.</p><note><p>Adding such constraints in a host language, however, is discouraged because it makes it difficult to re-use implementations of 
               the function library across host languages.</p></note><p>This specification allows flexibility in the choice of versions of specifications on which it depends:</p><ulist><item><p>It is <termref def="implementation-defined"/> which version of Unicode is supported, 
                     but it is recommended that the most recent version of Unicode be used.  </p></item><item><p>It is <termref def="implementation-defined"/> whether the type system is based
                     on XML Schema 1.0 or XML Schema 1.1.  </p></item><item><p>It is <termref def="implementation-defined"/> whether definitions that rely on
                     XML (for example, the set of valid XML characters) should use the definitions in XML 1.0 or XML 1.1.</p></item></ulist><note><p>The XML Schema 1.1 recommendation
                  introduces one new concrete datatype: <code>xs:dateTimeStamp</code>; it also incorporates
                  the types <code>xs:dayTimeDuration</code>, <code>xs:yearMonthDuration</code>,
                  and <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code> which were previously defined in earlier versions of <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"/>.
                  Furthermore, XSD 1.1
                  includes the option of supporting revised definitions of types such as <code>xs:NCName</code>
                  based on the rules in XML 1.1 rather than 1.0.</p></note><p>In this document, text labeled as an example or as a Note is

                    several namespaces (see <bibref ref="xml-names"/>) and referenced using an
                    <code>xs:QName</code>.</p><p>This document uses conventional prefixes to refer to these namespaces. User-written
               applications can choose a different prefix to refer to the namespace, so long as it is
               bound to the correct URI. The host language may also define a default namespace for
               function calls, in which case function names in that namespace need not be prefixed
               at all. In many cases the default namespace will be 
               <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>, allowing a call on the <code>fn:name</code>
               function (for example) to be written as <code>name()</code> rather than <code>fn:name()</code>; 
               in this document, however, all example function calls are explicitly prefixed.</p><p>The URIs of the namespaces and the conventional prefixes associated with them are:</p><ulist><item><p><code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</code> for constructors —

                     with the <code>op</code> prefix. For example, multiplication is generally
                     associated with the <code>*</code> operator, but it is described as a function

            not possible to have two different functions that have the same name and arity, but different
            types in their signature. That is, function overloading in this sense of the term is not permitted.
            Consequently, functions such as <code>fn:string</code> which accept arguments of many different
            types have a signature that defines a very general argument type, in this case <code>item()?</code>
            which accepts any single item; supplying an inappropriate item (such as a function item) causes
            a dynamic error.</p><p>Some functions on numeric types include the type <code>xs:numeric</code> in their signature
               as an argument or result type. In this version of the specification, <code>xs:numeric</code>
               has been redefined as a built-in union type representing the union of 
               <code>xs:decimal</code>, <code>xs:float</code>, <code>xs:double</code> (and thus automatically
               accepting types derived from these, including <code>xs:integer</code>).</p><p>Operators such as "+" may be overloaded: they map to different underlying functions depending
            on the dynamic types of the supplied operands.</p><p>It is possible for two functions to have the same name provided they have different arity (number of arguments).
               For the functions defined in this specification, where two functions have the same name and different arity,
               they also have closely related behavior, so they are defined in the same section of this document.</p></div2><div2 id="func-signatures"><head>Function signatures and descriptions</head><p>Each function (or group of functions having the same name) is defined in this specification using
            a standard proforma.</p><p>The function name is a <code>QName</code> as defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>
               and must adhere to its syntactic conventions. Following the precedent set by <bibref ref="xpath"/>,
               function names are generally composed of English words separated by hyphens ("-"). Abbreviations are
               used only where there is a strong precedent in other programming languages (as with <code>math:sin</code> and 
               <code>math:cos</code> for sine and cosine). If a
               function name contains a <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> datatype name, it may have
               intercapitalized spelling and is used in the function name as such. An example is <code>fn:timezone-from-dateTime</code>.</p><p>The first section in the proforma is a short summary of what the function does. This is intended
            to be informative rather than normative.</p><p>Each function is then defined by specifying its signature, which defines the
               types of the parameters and of the result value.</p><p>Each function's signature is presented in a form like this:</p><example role="signature"><proto role="example" name="function-name" return-type="return-type" returnEmptyOk="no" returnSeq="no" prefix="fn" returnVaries="no" isSchema="no" isDatatype="no" isSpecial="no" isOp="no"><arg name="parameter-name" type="parameter-type"/><arg name="..." type=""/></proto></example><p>In this notation, <term>function-name</term>, in bold-face, is the name of the
                    function whose signature is being specified. If the function takes no
                    parameters, then the name is followed by an empty parameter list:
                    "<code>()</code>"; otherwise, the name is followed by a parenthesized list of
                    parameter declarations, in which each declaration specifies the static type of the
                    parameter, in italics, and a descriptive, but non-normative, name. If there are
                    two or more parameter declarations, they are separated by a comma. The <emph>
                        <code>return-type</code></emph>, also in italics, specifies the static type of the value returned by the
                    function. The dynamic type of the value returned by the function is the same as its static
                    type or derived from the static type. All parameter types and return types are
                    specified using the SequenceType notation defined in <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-sequencetype-syntax"/>.</p><p>One function, <code>fn:concat</code>, has a variable number of arguments (two or more).
            More strictly, there is an infinite set of functions having the name <code>fn:concat</code>, with arity
            ranging from 2 to infinity. For this special case, a single function signature is given, with an ellipsis
            indicating an indefinite number of arguments.</p><p>The next section in the proforma defines the semantics of the function as a set of rules. 
               The order in which the rules appear is significant; they are to be applied in the order in which
               they are written. Error conditions, however, are generally listed in a separate section that follows
            the main rules, and take precedence over non-error rules except where otherwise stated. The principles outlined
            in <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-errors-and-opt"/> apply by default: to paraphrase, if the result of the function
            can be determined without evaluating all its arguments, then it is not necessary to evaluate the remaining arguments
            merely in order to determine whether any error conditions apply.</p><p>Where the proforma includes sections headed <emph>Notes</emph> or <emph>Examples</emph>, these are non-normative.</p><p>Rules for passing parameters to operators are described in the relevant sections
                    of <bibref ref="xquery-31"/> and <bibref ref="xpath-31"/>. For example, the rules for
                    passing parameters to arithmetic operators are described in <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-arithmetic"/>. Specifically, rules for parameters of
                    type <code>xs:untypedAtomic</code> and the empty sequence are specified in this section.</p><p>As is customary, the parameter type name indicates that the function or operator
                    accepts arguments of that type, or types derived from it, in that position. This
                    is called <emph>subtype substitution</emph> (See <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-sequencetype-matching"/>). In addition, numeric type instances and
                    instances of type <code>xs:anyURI</code> can be promoted to produce an argument
                    of the required type. (See <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="promotion"/>).</p><olist><item><p><emph>Subtype Substitution</emph>: A derived type may substitute for
                                its base type. In particular, <code>xs:integer</code> may be used
                                where <code>xs:decimal</code> is expected.</p></item><item><p><emph>Numeric Type Promotion</emph>: <code>xs:decimal</code> may be
                                promoted to <code>xs:float</code> or <code>xs:double</code>. 
								Promotion to <code>xs:double</code> should be done directly, not via
								 <code>xs:float</code>, to avoid loss of precision.</p></item><item><p><emph>anyURI Type Promotion</emph>: A value of
                                type <code>xs:anyURI</code> can be promoted to the
                                type <code>xs:string</code>. </p></item></olist><p>Some functions accept a single value or the empty sequence as an argument and
                    some may return a single value or the empty sequence. This is indicated in the
                    function signature by following the parameter or return type name with a
                    question mark: "<code>?</code>", indicating that either a single value or the
                    empty sequence must appear. See below.</p><example role="signature"><proto role="example" name="function-name" return-type="return-type" returnEmptyOk="yes" returnSeq="no" prefix="fn" returnVaries="no" isSchema="no" isDatatype="no" isSpecial="no" isOp="no"><arg name="parameter-name" type="parameter-type" emptyOk="yes"/></proto></example><p>Note that this function signature is different from a signature in which the
                    parameter is omitted. See, for example, the two signatures
                    for <code>fn:string</code>. In the first signature, the parameter is omitted
                    and the argument defaults to the context item, referred to as <code>.</code>.
                    In the second signature, the argument must be present but may be the empty
                    sequence, written as <code>()</code>.
                </p><p>Some functions accept a sequence of zero or more values as an argument. This is
                    indicated by following the name of the type of the items in the sequence with
                    <code>*</code>. The sequence may contain zero or more items of the named type.
                    For example, the function below accepts a sequence of <code>xs:double</code> and
                    returns a <code>xs:double</code> or the empty sequence.</p><example role="signature"><proto role="example" name="median" return-type="xs:double" returnEmptyOk="yes" returnSeq="no" prefix="fn" returnVaries="no" isSchema="no" isDatatype="no" isSpecial="no" isOp="no"><arg name="arg" type="xs:double*" emptyOk="no"/></proto></example></div2><div2 id="options" diff="add" at="D"><head>Options</head><p>As a matter of convention, a number of functions defined in this document take
            a parameter whose value is a map, defining options controlling the detail of how
            the function is evaluated. Maps are a new datatype introduced in XPath 3.1.</p><p>For example, the function <code>fn:xml-to-json</code> has an options parameter

                        behavior conditional on two function items being identical, the determination of identity is to some degree 
                        implementation-dependent. There are cases where function items are definitely not identical (for example 
                        if they have different name or arity), but positive determination of identity is possible only using 
                        implementation-dependent techniques, for example when both items contain references to the same piece of 
                        code representing the function's implementation.

         <p>This function never returns a value. Instead it always raises an error. The effect of
            the error is identical to the effect of dynamic errors raised implicitly, for example
            when an incorrect argument is supplied to a function.</p>
         <p>The parameters to the <code>fn:error</code> function supply information that is
            associated with the error condition and that is made available to a caller that asks for
            information about the error. The error may be caught either by the host language (using
            a try/catch construct in XSLT or XQuery, for example), or by the calling application or
            external processing environment. The way in which error information is returned to the
            external processing environment is <termref def="implementation-dependent">implementation-dependent</termref>.</p>
         
         <p>There are three pieces of information that may be associated with an error:</p>
         <ulist>
            <item>
               <p>The <code>$code</code> is an error code that distinguishes this error from others.
                  It is an <code>xs:QName</code>; the namespace URI conventionally identifies the
                  component, subsystem, or authority responsible for defining the meaning of the
                  error code, while the local part identifies the specific error condition. The
                  namespace URI <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/xqt-errors</code> is used for errors
                  defined in this specification; other namespace URIs may be used for errors defined
                  by the application.</p>
               <p>If the external processing environment expects the error code to be returned as a
                  URI or a string rather than as an <code>xs:QName</code>, then an error code with
                  namespace URI <code>NS</code> and local part <code>LP</code> will be returned in
                  the form <code>NS#LP</code>. The namespace URI part of the error code should
                  therefore not include a fragment identifier.</p>

                  if the function is called with no arguments or if the first argument is an empty sequence),

This specification uses  <bibref ref="ieee754-2008"/> arithmetic for <code>xs:float</code> and <code>xs:double</code> values.
One consequence of this is that some operations result in the value <code>NaN</code> (not-a number), which
has the unusual property that it is not equal to itself. Another consequence is that some operations return the value negative zero.
This differs from <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> which defines
<code>NaN</code> as being equal to itself and defines only a single zero in the value space.
 The text accompanying several functions defines behavior for both positive and negative zero inputs and outputs 
 in the interest of alignment with <bibref ref="ieee754-2008"/>. A conformant implementation must
 respect these semantics. In consequence, the expression <code>-0.0e0</code> (which is actually a unary minus operator 
    applied to an <code>xs:double</code> value) will always return negative zero: see <specref ref="func-numeric-unary-minus"/>. 
    As a concession to implementations that rely on implementations of XSD 1.0, however, when casting from string to double
 the lexical form <code>-0</code> <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be converted to positive zero, though negative zero
 is <rfc2119>recommended</rfc2119>.
</p><p>XML Schema 1.1 introduces support for positive and negative zero as distinct values, and also uses the <bibref ref="ieee754-2008"/>

                  implementation of xs:decimal that imposes no limits on the number of digits that
                  can be represented. The function is applied to this <code>xs:decimal</code> value,
                  and the resulting <code>xs:decimal</code> is cast back to <code>xs:float</code> or
                     <code>xs:double</code> as appropriate to form the function result. If the
                  resulting <code>xs:decimal</code> value is zero, then positive or negative zero is
                  returned according to the sign of the original argument.</p>

         <p role="note">This function is typically used in financial applications where the argument is of type
               <code>xs:decimal</code>. For arguments of type <code>xs:float</code> and
               <code>xs:double</code> the results may be counter-intuitive. For example, consider
               <code>round-half-to-even(xs:float(150.015), 2)</code>. The result is not 150.02 as
            might be expected, but 150.01. This is because the conversion of the
               <code>xs:float</code> value represented by the literal 150.015 to an
               <code>xs:decimal</code> produces the <code>xs:decimal</code> value 150.014999389...,
            which is closer to 150.01 than to 150.02.</p>

         <p>The value of <code>$picture</code> consists of a primary format token, optionally

            contains no semicolon then the entire picture is taken as the primary format token, and
            the format modifier is taken to be absent (which is equivalent to supplying a
            zero-length string).</p>



         <p>The primary format token is classified as one of the following:</p>
         <olist>
            <item>
               <p>A <var>decimal-digit-pattern</var> made up of <var>optional-digit-signs</var>,
                     <var>mandatory-digit-signs</var>, and <var>grouping-separator-signs</var>.</p>

                     <p>The <var>optional-digit-sign</var> is the character "#".</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>A <var>mandatory-digit-sign</var> is a <termref def="character">character</termref> in Unicode category <var>Nd</var>. All
                           <var>mandatory-digit-signs</var> within the format token
                           <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be from the same digit family, where a digit
                        family is a sequence of ten consecutive characters in Unicode category <var>Nd</var>,
                        having digit values 0 through 9. Within the format token, these digits are
                        interchangeable: a three-digit number may thus be indicated equivalently by
                           <code>000</code>, <code>001</code>, or <code>999</code>.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>a <var>grouping-separator-sign</var> is a non-alphanumeric character, that
                        is a <termref def="character">character</termref> whose Unicode category is
                        other than <var>Nd</var>, <var>Nl</var>, <var>No</var>, <var>Lu</var>, <var>Ll</var>,

               </ulist>

               <p>If the primary format token contains at least one Unicode digit then it is taken
                  as a decimal digit pattern, and in this case it <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> match the
                  regular expression <code>^((\p{Nd}|#|[^\p{N}\p{L}])+?)$</code>. If it contains a
                  digit but does not match this pattern, a dynamic error is raised <errorref class="DF" code="1310"/>.</p>

               <note>
                  <p>If a semicolon is to be used as a grouping separator, then the primary format
                     token as a whole must be followed by another semicolon, to ensure that the
                     grouping separator is not mistaken as a separator between the primary format
                     token and the format modifier.</p>
               </note>


               <p>There <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be at least one <var>mandatory-digit-sign</var>.
                  There may be zero or more <var>optional-digit-signs</var>, and (if present) these
                     <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> precede all <var>mandatory-digit-signs</var>. There may
                  be zero or more <var>grouping-separator-signs</var>. A
                     <var>grouping-separator-sign</var>
                  <rfc2119>must not</rfc2119> appear at the start or end of the
                     <var>decimal-digit-pattern</var>, nor adjacent to another
                     <var>grouping-separator-sign</var>.</p>

               <p>The corresponding output format is a decimal number, using this digit family, with
                  at least as many digits as there are <var>mandatory-digit-signs</var> in the
                  format token. Thus, a format token <code>1</code> generates the sequence <code>0 1
                     2 ... 10 11 12 ...</code>, and a format token <code>01</code> (or equivalently,
                     <code>00</code> or <code>99</code>) generates the sequence <code>00 01 02 ...
                     09 10 11 12 ... 99 100 101</code>. A format token of <code>&amp;#x661;</code>
                  (Arabic-Indic digit one) generates the sequence <code>١</code> then <code>٢</code>
                  then <code>٣</code> ...</p>

         <p>For all format tokens other than a <var>decimal-digit-pattern</var>, there 
            <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref> lower and upper bounds on the range of numbers that
            can be formatted using this format token; indeed, for some numbering sequences there may
            be intrinsic limits. For example, the format token <code>&amp;#x2460;</code> (circled
            digit one, ①) has a range imposed by the Unicode character repertoire — <phrase diff="chg" at="D">zero to 20</phrase>
            in Unicode versions prior to <phrase diff="chg" at="D">3.2</phrase>, or <phrase diff="chg" at="D">zero to 50</phrase> in subsequent versions. For the numbering
            sequences described above any upper bound imposed by the implementation <rfc2119>must
               not</rfc2119> be less than 1000 (one thousand) and any lower bound must not be
            greater than 1. Numbers that fall outside this range <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be
            formatted using the format token <code>1</code>.</p>
         <p>The above expansions of numbering sequences for format tokens such as <code>a</code> and
               <code>i</code> are indicative but not prescriptive. There are various conventions in
            use for how alphabetic sequences continue when the alphabet is exhausted, and differing
            conventions for how roman numerals are written (for example, <code>IV</code> versus
               <code>IIII</code> as the representation of the number 4). Sometimes alphabetic
            sequences are used that omit letters such as <code>i</code> and <code>o</code>. This
            specification does not prescribe the detail of any sequence other than those sequences
            consisting entirely of decimal digits.</p>
         <p>Many numbering sequences are language-sensitive. This applies especially to the sequence
            selected by the tokens <code>w</code>, <code>W</code> and <code>Ww</code>. It also
            applies to other sequences, for example different languages using the Cyrillic alphabet
            use different sequences of characters, each starting with the letter #x410 (Cyrillic
            capital letter A). In such cases, the <code>$lang</code> argument specifies which
            language's conventions are to be used. If the argument is specified, the value
               <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> be either an empty sequence or a value that would be valid
            for the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute (see <bibref ref="xml"/>). Note that this
            permits the identification of sublanguages based on country codes (from ISO 3166-1) as
            well as identification of dialects and regions within a country.</p>
         <p>The set of languages for which numbering is supported is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>. If the <code>$lang</code> argument is absent, or is
            set to an empty sequence, or is invalid, or is not a language supported by the
            implementation, then the number is formatted using the default language from the dynamic
            context. </p>
         <p>The format modifier <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be a string that matches the regular
            expression <code>^([co](\(.+\))?)?[at]?$</code>. That is, if it is present it must
            consist of one or more of the following, in order:</p>
         <ulist>
            <item>
               <p>either <code>c</code> or <code>o</code>, optionally followed by a sequence of
                  characters enclosed between parentheses, to indicate cardinal or ordinal numbering
                  respectively, the default being cardinal numbering</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>either <code>a</code> or <code>t</code>, to indicate alphabetic or traditional
                  numbering respectively, the default being <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>.</p>
            </item>
         </ulist>
         <p>If the <code>o</code> modifier is present, this indicates a request to output ordinal
            numbers rather than cardinal numbers. For example, in English, when used with the format
            token <code>1</code>, this outputs the sequence <code>1st 2nd 3rd 4th ...</code>, and
            when used with the format token <code>w</code> outputs the sequence <code>first second
               third fourth ...</code>.</p>
         <p>The string of characters between the parentheses, if present, is used to select between
            other possible variations of cardinal or ordinal numbering sequences. The interpretation
            of this string is <termref def="implemementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>. No error occurs if the implementation does not
            define any interpretation for the defined string.</p>

         
         <p>It is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref> what
            combinations of values of the format token, the language, and the cardinal/ordinal
            modifier are supported. If ordinal numbering is not supported for the combination of the
            format token, the language, and the string appearing in parentheses, the request is
            ignored and cardinal numbers are generated instead.</p>
         
         <p>The use of the <code>a</code> or <code>t</code> modifier disambiguates between numbering
            sequences that use letters. In many languages there are two commonly used numbering
            sequences that use letters. One numbering sequence assigns numeric values to letters in
            alphabetic sequence, and the other assigns numeric values to each letter in some other
            manner traditional in that language. In English, these would correspond to the numbering
            sequences specified by the format tokens <code>a</code> and <code>i</code>. In some
            languages, the first member of each sequence is the same, and so the format token alone
            would be ambiguous. In the absence of the <code>a</code> or <code>t</code> modifier, the
            default is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>.</p>
      </def></gitem><gitem><label>Error Conditions</label><def>
         <p>A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="DF" code="1310"/> if the format token is
            invalid, that is, if it violates any mandatory rules (indicated by an emphasized
               <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> or <rfc2119>required</rfc2119> keyword in the above rules).
            For example, the error is raised if the primary format token contains a digit but does
            not match the required regular expression.</p>

            <item><p>The following notes apply when ordinal numbering is selected using the <code>o</code> modifier.</p>
               <p>In some languages, the form of numbers (especially ordinal numbers) varies depending 
                  on the grammatical context: they may have different genders and may decline with the 
                  noun that they qualify. In such cases the string appearing in parentheses after the 
                  letter <code>c</code> or <code>o</code> may be used to indicate the variation of the 
                  cardinal or ordinal number required.</p> 
                  
                  <p>The way in which the variation is indicated will depend on the conventions of the language.</p> 
                  
                  <p>For inflected languages that vary the ending of the word, the approach recommended 
                     in the previous version of this specification was to indicate the required ending, 
                     preceded by a hyphen: for example in German, appropriate values might be 
                     <code>o(-e)</code>, <code>o(-er)</code>, <code>o(-es)</code>, <code>o(-en)</code>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Another approach, which might usefully be adopted by an implementation based on the 
                     open-source ICU localization library <bibref ref="ICU"/>, or any other library making use of the 
                     Unicode Common Locale Data Repository <bibref ref="CLDR"/>, is to allow the value in parentheses 
                     to be the name of a registered numbering rule set for the language in question, 
                     conventionally prefixed with a percent sign: for example, 
                     <code>o(%spellout-ordinal-masculine)</code>, or <code>c(%spellout-cardinal-year)</code>.

         <p>The effect of the two-argument form of the function is equivalent to calling the
            three-argument form with an empty sequence as the value of the third argument.</p>
         <p>The function formats <code>$value</code> as a string using the <termref def="dt-picture-string">picture string</termref> specified by the
               <code>$picture</code> argument and the decimal-format named by the
               <code>$decimal-format-name</code> argument, or the unnamed decimal-format, if there
            is no <code>$decimal-format-name</code> argument. The syntax of the picture string is
            described in <specref ref="syntax-of-picture-string"/>.</p>
         <p>The <code>$value</code> argument may be of any numeric data type
            (<code>xs:double</code>, <code>xs:float</code>, <code>xs:decimal</code>, or their
            subtypes including <code>xs:integer</code>). Note that if an <code>xs:decimal</code> is
            supplied, it is not automatically promoted to an <code>xs:double</code>, as such
            promotion can involve a loss of precision.</p>
         <p>If the supplied value of the <code>$value</code> argument is an empty sequence, the
            function behaves as if the supplied value were the <code>xs:double</code> value
               <code>NaN</code>.</p>
         <p>The value of <code>$decimal-format-name</code>, if present and non-empty,
               <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be a string which after removal of leading and trailing
            whitespace is in the form of an <code>EQName</code> as defined in the XPath 3.0
            grammar, that is one of the following:</p>

         <ulist>
            <item>
               <p>A lexical QName, which is expanded using the statically known namespaces. The
                  default namespace is not used (no prefix means no namespace).</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>A <code>URIQualifiedName</code> using the syntax <code>Q{uri}local</code>, where
                  the URI can be zero-length to indicate a name in no namespace.</p>
            </item>
         </ulist>


         <p>The decimal format that is used is the decimal format in the static context whose name
            matches <code>$decimal-format-name</code> if supplied, or the unnamed decimal format in
            the static context otherwise.</p>

         <p>The evaluation of the <code>fn:format-number</code> function takes place in two
            phases, an analysis phase described in <specref ref="analyzing-picture-string"/> and a
            formatting phase described in <specref ref="formatting-the-number"/>.</p>

         <p>The analysis phase takes as its inputs the <termref def="dt-picture-string">picture
               string</termref> and the variables derived from the relevant decimal format in the
            static context, and produces as its output a number of variables with defined values.
            The formatting phase takes as its inputs the number to be formatted and the variables
            produced by the analysis phase, and produces as its output a string containing a
            formatted representation of the number.</p>

         <p>The result of the function is the formatted string representation of the supplied
            number.</p>

      </def></gitem><gitem><label>Error Conditions</label><def>
         <p>A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="DF" code="1280"/> if the name specified as
            the <code>$decimal-format-name</code> argument is neither a valid lexical QName nor a
            valid <code>URIQualifiedName</code>, or if it uses a prefix that is not found in the
            statically known namespaces, or if the static context does not contain a declaration of
            a decimal-format with a matching expanded QName. If the processor is able to detect the
            error statically (for example, when the argument is supplied as a string literal), then
            the processor <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> optionally signal this as a static error.</p>

         <p role="note">It is not meaningful to ask whether the functions returned in the <code>next</code> and <code>permute</code>
            functions resulting from two separate calls with the same seed are "the same function", but the functions must be equivalent in the sense
            that calling them produces the same sequence of random numbers.</p>
         <p role="note">The repeatability of the results of function calls in different execution scopes is outside the scope of this
            specification. It is <rfc2119>recommended</rfc2119> that when the same seed is provided explicitly, the same random number sequence
            should be delivered even in different execution scopes; while if no seed is provided, the processor should choose a seed
            that is likely to be different from one execution scope to another. (The same effect can be achieved explicitly by using
         <code>fn:current-dateTime()</code> as a seed.)</p>
         <p role="note">The specification does not place strong conformance requirements on the actual randomness of the result; this is left to 
            the implementation. It is desirable, for example, when generating a sequence
         of random numbers that the sequence should not get into a repeating loop; but the specification does not attempt to dictate this.</p>

                        compared and, by extension, ordered. When values whose type is
                        <code>xs:string</code> or a type derived from <code>xs:string</code> are
                        compared (or, equivalently, sorted), the comparisons are inherently
                        performed according to some collation (even if that collation is defined
                        entirely on codepoint values). The <bibref ref="charmod"/> observes that
                        some applications may require different comparison and ordering behaviors
                        than other applications. Similarly, some users having particular linguistic
                        expectations may require different behaviors than other users. Consequently,
                        the collation must be taken into account when comparing strings in any
                        context. Several functions in this and the following section make use of a
                        collation. </p><p>Collations can indicate that two different codepoints are, in fact, equal
                        for comparison purposes (e.g., "v" and "w" are considered equivalent in
                        some Swedish collations). Strings can be compared codepoint-by-codepoint or in a
                        linguistically appropriate manner, as defined by the collation. </p><p>Some collations, especially those based on the

                        perform tailoring. Instead, it assumes that the collation argument to the
                        various functions below is a tailored and named collation.</p><p>The <termref def="dt-codepoint-collation">Unicode codepoint collation</termref> is a collation

Thus, the <bibref ref="charmod-normalization"/> recommends that all strings be subjected to early Unicode normalization and some collations will raise runtime errors if they encounter strings that are not properly normalized.  However, it is not possible to guarantee that all
                        strings in all XML documents are, in fact, normalized, or that they are
                        normalized in the same manner. In order to maximize interoperability of 
                        operations on XML documents in general, there may be collations that operate
                        on unnormalized strings and other collations that
                        implicitly normalize strings before comparing them. Applications may choose the kind of collation best suited for their needs.  Note that collations based
                        on the Unicode collation algorithm implicitly normalize strings before comparison and produce equivalent results regardless of
                        a string's normalization.</p><p diff="add" at="A">Collations may or may not perform Unicode normalization on strings before comparing them.</p><p>This specification assumes that collations are named and that the collation
                        name may be provided as an argument to string functions. Functions that
                        allow specification of a collation do so with an argument whose type is
                        <code>xs:string</code> but whose lexical form must conform to an
                        <code>xs:anyURI</code>. If the collation is specified using a relative URI reference, 
                  it is resolved relative to the value of the
                     static base URI property from the static context. 
                  This specification also defines the manner in which a
                        default collation is determined if the collation argument is not specified
                        in calls of functions that use a collation but allow it to be omitted. </p><p>This specification does not define whether or not the collation URI is
					dereferenced. The collation URI may be an abstract identifier, or it may
					refer to an actual resource describing the collation. If it refers to a
					resource, this specification does not define the nature of that resource.
					One possible candidate is that the resource is a locale description
					expressed using the Locale Data Markup Language: see <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR35"/>.
					</p><p>Functions such as <code>fn:compare</code> and <code>fn:max</code> that
                        compare <code>xs:string</code> values use a single collation URI to identify
                        all aspects of the collation rules. This means that any parameters such as
                        the strength of the collation must be specified as part of the collation
                        URI. For example, suppose there is a collation 
                            <code>http://www.example.com/collations/French</code>
                         that refers to a French collation that compares on the basis of
                        base characters. Collations that use the same basic rules, but with higher
                        strengths, for example, base characters and accents, or base characters,
                        accents and case, would need to be given different names, say 
                            <code>http://www.example.com/collations/French1</code>
                         and

                  Note that some specifications use the term collation to refer to
                        an algorithm that can be parameterized, but in this specification, each
                        possible parameterization is considered to be a distinct collation.</p><p>The XQuery/XPath static context includes a provision for a default collation
                        that can be used for string comparisons and ordering operations. See the

                  collation that most closely reflects the user's intentions. For example, if the collation URI requested is

                  from the UCA definition, or one whose conformance has not been established. It might even, as a last resort, fall back to using
                  codepoint collation.</p><p>If two query parameters use the same keyword then the last one wins. If a query parameter uses a keyword or value which is not

         <p role="note">The function is provided primarily for use with maps. If a map is required where
            codepoint equality is inappropriate for comparing keys, then a common technique is to
            normalize the key so that equality matching becomes feasible. There are many ways
            keys can be normalized, for example by use of functions such as
               <code>fn:upper-case</code>, <code>fn:lower-case</code>,
               <code>fn:normalize-space</code>, or <code>fn:normalize-unicode</code>, but this
            function provides a way of normalizing them according to the rules of a specified
            collation. For example, if the collation ignores accents, then the function will
            generate the same collation key for two input strings that differ only in their use of
            accents.</p>
         <p role="note">The result of the function is defined to be an <code>xs:base64Binary</code> value. Binary values
         are chosen because they have unambiguous and context-free comparison semantics, because the value space
         is unbounded, and because the ordering rules are such that between any two values in the ordered value space, an
         arbitrary number of further values can be interpolated. The choice between <code>xs:base64Binary</code>
            and <code>xs:hexBinary</code> is arbitrary; the only operation that behaves differently between the two binary
            data types is conversion to/from a string, and this operation is not one that is normally required for
            effective use of collation keys.
         </p>
         <p role="note">For collations based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm, an algorithm for computing
            collation keys is provided in <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR10"/>. Implementations are
               <rfc2119>not required</rfc2119> to use this algorithm.</p>
         <p role="note">This specification does not mandate that collation keys should retain ordering. This is
            partly because the primary use case is for maps, where only equality comparisons are
            required, and partly to allow the use of binary data types (which are currently
            unordered types) for the result. The specification may be revised in a future release to
            specify that ordering is preserved.</p>
         <p role="note">The fact that collation keys are ordered can be exploited in XQuery, whose <code>order by</code>
         clause does not allow the collation to be selected dynamically. This restriction can be circumvented
         by rewriting the clause <code>order by $e/@key collation "URI"</code> as <code>order by fn:collation-key($e/@key, $collation)</code>,
         where <code>$collation</code> allows the collation to be chosen dynamically.</p>
         <p role="note">Note that <code>xs:base64Binary</code> becomes an ordered type
         in XPath 3.1, making binary collation keys possible.</p>

                    whether it contains another string <code>$arg2</code> as a substring. The result
                    depends on whether <code>$arg2</code> is a substring of <code>$arg1</code>, and
               if so, on the range of <termref def="character">characters</termref> in <code>$arg1</code> which <code>$arg2</code> matches.</p><p>When the <termref def="dt-codepoint-collation">Unicode codepoint collation</termref>
                    is used, this simply involves determining whether <code>$arg1</code> contains a
               contiguous sequence of characters whose <termref def="codepoint">codepoints</termref> are the same, one for one,
                    with the codepoints of the characters in <code>$arg2</code>.</p><p>When a collation is specified, the rules are more complex.</p><p>All collations support the capability of deciding whether two <termref def="string">strings</termref> are
                    considered equal, and if not, which of the strings should be regarded as
                    preceding the other. For functions such as <code>fn:compare</code>, this is
                    all that is required. For other functions, such as <code>fn:contains</code>,
                    the collation needs to support an additional property: it must be able to
                    decompose the string into a sequence of collation units, each unit consisting of
                    one or more characters, such that two strings can be compared by pairwise
                    comparison of these units. ("collation unit" is equivalent to "collation
                    element" as defined in <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR10"/>.) The string
                    <code>$arg1</code> is then considered to contain <code>$arg2</code> as a
                    substring if the sequence of collation units corresponding to <code>$arg2</code>
                    is a subsequence of the sequence of the collation units corresponding to
                    <code>$arg1</code>. The characters in <code>$arg1</code> that match are the
                    characters corresponding to these collation units.</p><p>This rule may occasionally lead to surprises. For example, consider a collation
                    that treats "Jaeger" and "Jäger" as equal. It might do this by
                    treating "ä" as representing two collation units, in which case the
                        expression <code>fn:contains("Jäger", "eg")</code> will return
                    <code>true</code>. Alternatively, a collation might treat "ae" as a single
                    collation unit, in which case the expression <code>fn:contains("Jaeger",
                    "eg")</code> will return <code>false</code>. The results of these functions thus
                    depend strongly on the properties of the collation that is used.</p><p>In addition,
                    collations may specify that some collation units should be ignored during matching. If hyphen is an ignored
					collation unit, then <code>fn:contains("code-point", "codepoint")</code> will be true, 
					and <code>fn:contains("codepoint", "-")</code> will also be true.</p><p> In the definitions below, we refer to the terms <term>match</term> and
                    <term>minimal match</term> as defined in definitions DS2 and DS4 of

                    compare two strings, but that does not have the capability to split the string
                    into collation units. Such a collation may cause the function to fail, or to
                    give unexpected results or it may be rejected as an unsuitable argument. The

                        languages such as Perl. However, because XML Schema uses regular expressions
                        only for validity checking, it omits some facilities that are widely-used
                        with languages such as Perl. This section, therefore, describes extensions
                        to the XML Schema regular expressions syntax that reinstate these capabilities.</p><note><p>
It is recommended that implementers consult <bibref ref="UNICODE-TR18"/> for information on using regular expression processing on Unicode characters.</p></note><p>The regular expression syntax and semantics are identical to those

                  to the syntax or semantics of regular expressions relative to XSD 1.0, but a number
                  of errors and ambiguities have been resolved. For example, the rules for the 
                  interpretation of hyphens within square brackets in a regular expression have been 
                  clarified; and the semantics of regular expressions are no longer tied to a specific 
                  version of Unicode.</p><p>Implementers, even in cases where XSD 1.1 is not supported, are advised to consult
               the XSD 1.1 regular expression specification for guidance on how to handle cases where
               the XSD 1.0 specification is unclear or inconsistent.</p></note><div4 id="matching-start-and-end"><head>Matching the Start and End of the String</head><p> Two meta-characters, <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are

         <p>The <code>$flags</code> argument is interpreted in the same manner as for the

         <p>The function returns the <code>xs:string</code> that is obtained by replacing each
            non-overlapping substring of <code>$input</code> that matches the given

         <p>If the <code>q</code> flag is present, the replacement string is used <emph>as

         <p>Otherwise, within the <code>$replacement</code> string, a variable <code>$N</code> may
            be used to refer to the substring captured by the Nth parenthesized sub-expression in
            the regular expression. For each match of the pattern, these variables are assigned the
            value of the content matched by the relevant sub-expression, and the modified
            replacement string is then substituted for the <termref def="character">characters</termref> in <code>$input</code> that matched the pattern.
               <code>$0</code> refers to the substring captured by the regular expression as a
            whole.</p>
         <p>More specifically, the rules are as follows, where <code>S</code> is the number of
            parenthesized sub-expressions in the regular expression, and <code>N</code> is the
            decimal number formed by taking all the digits that consecutively follow the

         <olist>

               <p>If <code>N</code>=<code>0</code>, then the variable is replaced by the substring

            </item>
            <item>
               <p>If <code>1</code>&lt;=<code>N</code>&lt;=<code>S</code>, then the variable is
                  replaced by the substring captured by the Nth parenthesized sub-expression. If the
                     <code>Nth</code> parenthesized sub-expression was not matched, then the
                  variable is replaced by the zero-length string.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>If <code>S</code>&lt;<code>N</code>&lt;=<code>9</code>, then the variable is

            </item>
            <item>
               <p>Otherwise (if <code>N</code>&gt;<code>S</code> and
                     <code>N</code>&gt;<code>9</code>), the last digit of <code>N</code> is taken to
                  be a literal character to be included "as is" in the replacement string, and the
                  rules are reapplied using the number <code>N</code> formed by stripping off this
                  last digit.</p>
            </item>
         </olist>

         <p>For example, if the replacement string is 
               <code>"$23"</code>
             and there are 5 substrings, the result contains the value of the substring that
            matches the second sub-expression, followed by the digit 
               <code>3</code>.</p>
         <p>Unless the <code>q</code> flag is used, a literal <code>$</code> character within the
            replacement string must be written as <code>\$</code>, and a literal <code>\</code>
            character must be written as <code>\\</code>.</p>

         <p> If two alternatives within the pattern both match at the same position in the
               <code>$input</code>, then the match that is chosen is the one matched by the first
            alternative. For example:</p>
         <eg xml:space="preserve"> fn:replace("abcd", "(ab)|(a)", "[1=$1][2=$2]") returns "[1=ab][2=]cd"</eg>

         <p>The effect of calling the first version of this function (omitting the argument
               <code>$flags</code>) is the same as the effect of calling the second version with the
               <code>$flags</code> argument set to a zero-length string. Flags are defined in
               <specref ref="flags"/>.</p>
         <p>The <code>$flags</code> argument is interpreted in the same way as for the
               <code>fn:matches</code> function.</p>
         <p>If <code>$input</code> is the empty sequence the function behaves as if
               <code>$input</code> were the zero-length string. In this situation the result will be
            an element node with no children.</p>
         <p>The function returns an element node whose local name is
               <code>analyze-string-result</code>. This element and all its descendant elements have
            the namespace URI <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>. The namespace
            prefix is <termref def="implementation-dependent">implementation-dependent</termref>. The children of this element are a
            sequence of <code>fn:match</code> and <code>fn:non-match</code> elements. This sequence
            is formed by breaking the <code>$input</code> string into a sequence of strings,
            returning any substring that matches <code>$pattern</code> as the content of a
               <code>match</code> element, and any intervening substring as the content of a
               <code>non-match</code> element.</p>
         <p>More specifically, the function starts at the beginning of the input string and attempts
            to find the first substring that matches the regular expression. If there are several
            matches, the first match is defined to be the one whose starting position comes first in
            the string. If several alternatives within the regular expression both match at the same
            position in the input string, then the match that is chosen is the first alternative
            that matches. For example, if the input string is <code>The quick brown fox jumps</code>
            and the regular expression is <code>jump|jumps</code>, then the match that is chosen is
               <code>jump</code>.</p>

         <p>Having found the first match, the instruction proceeds to find the second and subsequent
            matches by repeating the search, starting at the first <termref def="character">character</termref> that was not included in the previous match.</p>

         <p>The input string is thus partitioned into a sequence of substrings, some of which match
            the regular expression, others which do not match it. Each substring will contain at
            least one character. This sequence is represented in the result by the sequence of
               <code>fn:match</code> and <code>fn:non-match</code> children of the returned element
            node; the string value of the <code>fn:match</code> or <code>fn:non-match</code> element
            will be the corresponding substring of <code>$input</code>, and the string value of the
            returned element node will therefore be the same as <code>$input</code>.</p>

         <p>The content of an <code>fn:non-match</code> element is always a single text node.</p>

         <p>The content of a <code>fn:match</code> element, however, is in general a sequence of
            text nodes and <code>fn:group</code> element children. An <code>fn:group</code> element
            with a <code>nr</code> attribute having the integer value <var>N</var> identifies the
            substring captured by the <var>Nth</var> parenthesized sub-expression in the regular
            expression. For each capturing subexpression there will be at most one corresponding
               <code>fn:group</code> element in each <code>fn:match</code> element in the
            result.</p>

         <p>If the function is called twice with the same arguments, it is <termref def="implementation-dependent">implementation-dependent</termref> whether the two calls return the same element node
            or distinct (but deep equal) element nodes. In this respect it is <termref def="nondeterministic">non-deterministic with respect to node identity</termref>.</p>

         <p role="note">It is <rfc2119>recommended</rfc2119> that a processor that implements schema awareness should return typed nodes.
            The concept of "schema awareness", however, is a matter for host languages to define and is outside
            the scope of the function library specification.</p>
         <p role="note">The declarations and definitions in the schema are not automatically available in
            the static context of the <code>fn:analyze-string</code> call (or of any other
            expression). The contents of the static context are host-language defined, and in some
            host languages are implementation-defined.</p>
         <p role="note">The schema defines the outermost element, <code>analyze-string-result</code>, in such
         a way that mixed content is permitted. In fact the element will only have element nodes (<code>match</code>
         and <code>non-match</code>) as its children, never text nodes. Although this might have originally been an
            oversight, defining the <code>analyze-string-result</code> element with <code>mixed="true"</code> allows it
         to be atomized, which is potentially useful (the atomized value will be the original input string),
         and the capability has therefore been retained for compatibility with the 3.0 version of this

                    date/time datatypes. Each operator takes two operands of the same
                    type and returns an <code>xs:boolean</code> result.</p><p>
               <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> also states that the
                    order relation on date and time datatypes is
                    not a total order but a partial order because these
datatypes may or may not have a timezone.  This is handled as follows.
If either operand to a comparison function on date or time values does not have
                    an (explicit) timezone then, for the purpose of the operation, an implicit
                    timezone, provided by the dynamic context <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-xp-evaluation-context-components"/>, is assumed to be present as part of
                    the value. This creates a total order for all date and time values.</p><p>An <code>xs:dateTime</code> can be considered to consist of seven components:
<code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code>, 
<code>second</code> and <code>timezone</code>.  For <code>xs:dateTime</code> six components (<code>year</code>, 
<code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code> and <code>second</code>) are required  
and  <code>timezone</code> is optional.   For other date/time values, of the first six components, some are required 
			   and others must be <xtermref ref="dt-absent" spec="DM31">absent</xtermref>.  
			   <code>Timezone</code> is always optional.  For example, for <code>xs:date</code>, 
the <code>year</code>, <code>month</code> and <code>day</code> components are required and <code>hour</code>, 
<code>minute</code> and <code>second</code> components must be absent;  for <code>xs:time</code> the <code>hour</code>, 
<code>minute</code> and <code>second</code> components are required and <code>year</code>, <code>month</code> and 
<code>day</code> are missing;  for <code>xs:gDay</code>, <code>day</code> is required and <code>year</code>, 
<code>month</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code> and <code>second</code> are missing.</p><note><p>In <bibref ref="xmlschema11-2"/>, a new <code>explicitTimezone</code> facet is available with values
            <code>optional</code>, <code>required</code>, or <code>prohibited</code> to 
            enable the timezone to be defined as mandatory or disallowed.</p></note><p>Values of the date/time datatypes <code>xs:time</code>, <code>xs:gMonthDay</code>, <code>xs:gMonth</code>, 
			and <code>xs:gDay</code>, can be considered to represent a sequence of recurring time instants or time periods.  
			An <code>xs:time</code> occurs every day.  An <code>xs:gMonth</code> occurs every year.  Comparison operators 
			on these datatypes compare the starting instants of equivalent occurrences in the recurring series.  
			These <code>xs:dateTime</code> values are calculated  as described below.</p><p>Comparison operators on <code>xs:date</code>, <code>xs:gYearMonth</code> and <code>xs:gYear</code> compare 
			their starting instants. These <code>xs:dateTime</code> values are calculated  as described below.</p><p>The starting instant of an occurrence of a date/time value is an <code>xs:dateTime</code> 
             calculated by filling 
			in the missing components of the local value from a reference <code>xs:dateTime</code>.  An example of a suitable
         reference <code>xs:dateTime</code> is <code>1972-01-01T00:00:00</code>. Then, for example, the starting
             instant corresponding to the <code>xs:date</code> value <code>2009-03-12</code> is 
             <code>2009-03-12T00:00:00</code>; the starting instant corresponding to the <code>xs:time</code> value
             <code>13:30:02</code> is <code>1972-01-01T13:30:02</code>; and the starting instant corresponding to the
             <code>gMonthDay</code> value <code>--02-29</code> is <code>1972-02-29T00:00:00</code> (which explains
             why a leap year was chosen for the reference).</p><note><p>In the previous version of this specification, the reference date/time chosen was
         <code>1972-12-31T00:00:00</code>. While this gives the same results, it produces a "starting instant" for 
         a <code>gMonth</code> or <code>gMonthDay</code> that bears no
         relation to the ordinary meaning of the term, and it also required special handling of short months. 
         The original choice was made to allow for leap seconds; but since leap seconds are not recognized 
         in date/time arithmetic, this is not actually necessary.</p></note><p>If the <code>xs:time</code> value written as
			<code>24:00:00</code> is to be compared, filling in the missing components gives <code>1972-01-01T00:00:00</code>, 
			because <code>24:00:00</code> is an alternative representation of <code>00:00:00</code> (the lexical value 
			<code>"24:00:00"</code> is
			converted to the time components {0,0,0} before the missing components are filled
			in). This has the consequence that when ordering <code>xs:time</code> values, 
			<code>24:00:00</code> is
			considered to be earlier than <code>23:59:59</code>. However, when ordering 
			<code>xs:dateTime</code>
			values, a time component of <code>24:00:00</code> is considered equivalent to <code>00:00:00</code> on the
			following day.</p><p>Note that the reference <code>xs:dateTime</code> does not have a timezone.  The <code>timezone</code> component 
			is never filled in from the reference <code>xs:dateTime</code>.  In some cases, if the date/time value does not 
			have a timezone, the implicit timezone from the dynamic context is used as the timezone.</p><note><p>This specification uses the reference <code>xs:dateTime 1972-01-01T00:00:00</code> in the description of the 
			   comparison operators.  Implementations may use other reference <code>xs:dateTime</code> values 
			   as long as they yield the same results.  The reference <code>xs:dateTime</code> used must meet the following 
			   constraints:  when it is used to supply components into <code>xs:gMonthDay</code> values, the year must allow 
			   for February 29 and so must be a leap year; when it is used to supply missing components into <code>xs:gDay</code> 
			   values, the month must allow for 31 days.  Different reference <code>xs:dateTime</code> values may be used for 
			   different operators.</p></note><div3 id="func-dateTime-equal"><head>op:dateTime-equal</head><glist><gitem><label>Summary</label><def>

A substring enclosed in square brackets is interpreted as a variable marker; substrings

The literal substrings are optional and if present are rendered unchanged, including any whitespace. 
If an opening or closing square bracket 
is required within a literal substring, it <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be doubled.
The variable markers are replaced in the result by strings representing 
aspects of the date and/or time to be formatted. These are described in detail below.</p><p>A variable marker consists of a component specifier followed optionally 
by one or two presentation modifiers and/or optionally by a width modifier.
Whitespace within a variable marker is ignored.</p><p>The variable marker may be separated into its components

                  contains a single character, this is interpreted as the first presentation modifier.
                  If it contains more than one character, the last character is examined: if it is valid
                  as a second presentation modifier then it is treated as such, and the preceding part
                  of the substring constitutes the first presentation modifier. Otherwise, the second

There may be ambiguities when dates are recorded using different calendars. 
For example, the start of a new day is not simultaneous in different calendars, 
and may also vary geographically (for example, based on the time of sunrise or sunset).
Translation of dates is therefore more reliable when the time of day is also known, and
when the geographic location is known. 
When translating dates between
one calendar and another, the processor may take account of the values
of the <code>$place</code> and/or <code>$language</code> arguments, with the 
                     <code>$place</code>
argument taking precedence.</p><p>Information about some of these calendars, and algorithms for converting between them, may

It is 
<termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref> which
calendars are supported.</p><p>The ISO 8601 calendar (<bibref ref="ISO8601"/>), 
which is included in the above list and designated <code>ISO</code>, 
is very similar to the Gregorian calendar designated <code>AD</code>, but it
differs in several ways. The ISO calendar
    is intended to ensure that date and time formats can be read
    easily by other software, as well as being legible for human
    users. The ISO calendar
prescribes the use of particular numbering conventions as defined in
ISO 8601, rather than allowing these to be localized on a per-language basis. 
In particular it
    provides a numeric 'week date' format which identifies dates by
    year, week of the year, and day in the week; 
in the ISO calendar the days of the week are numbered from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday), and
week 1 in any calendar year is the week (from Monday to Sunday) that includes the first Thursday
of that year. The numeric values of the components year, month, day, hour, minute, and second
are the same in the ISO calendar as the values used in the lexical representation of the date and
time as defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. The era ("E" component)
with this calendar is either a minus sign (for negative years) or a zero-length string (for positive years).
For dates before 1 January, AD 1, year numbers in
    the ISO and AD calendars are off by one from each other: ISO year
    0000 is 1 BC, -0001 is 2 BC, etc.</p><p>ISO 8601 does not define a numbering for weeks within a month. When the <code>w</code>
               component is used, the convention to be adopted is that each Monday-to-Sunday week is considered to
               fall within a particular month if its Thursday occurs in that month; the weeks that fall in a particular
               month under this definition are numbered starting from 1. Thus, for example, 
               29 January 2013 falls in week 5 because the Thursday of the week (31 January 2013) is the fifth Thursday
               in January, and 1 February 2013 is also in week 5 for the same reason.</p><note><p>The value space of the date and time datatypes, as defined in XML Schema, is based on
absolute points in time. The lexical space of these datatypes defines a 
representation of these absolute points in time using the proleptic Gregorian calendar,
that is, the modern Western calendar extrapolated into the past and the future; but the value space
is calendar-neutral. The
<termref def="dt-date-formatting-function">date formatting functions</termref> produce a representation
of this absolute point in time, but denoted in a possibly different calendar. So,
for example, the date whose lexical representation in XML Schema is <code>1502-01-11</code> 
(the day on which Pope Gregory XIII was born) might be
formatted using the Old Style (Julian) calendar as <code>1 January 1502</code>. This reflects the fact
that there was at that time a ten-day difference between the two calendars. It would be
incorrect, and would produce incorrect results, to represent this date in an element or attribute 
of type <code>xs:date</code> as <code>1502-01-01</code>, even though this might reflect the way 
the date was recorded in contemporary documents.</p><p>When referring to years occurring in antiquity, modern historians generally
use a numbering system in which there is no year zero (the year before 1 CE
is thus 1 BCE). This is the convention that <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> be used when the
requested calendar is OS (Julian) or AD (Gregorian). When the requested
calendar is ISO, however, the conventions of ISO 8601 <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> be followed:
here the year before +0001 is numbered zero. In <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> (version 1.0), 
the value space for <code>xs:date</code> and <code>xs:dateTime</code>
does not include a year zero: however, XSD 1.1 endorses the ISO 8601 convention. This means that the date on
which Julius Caesar was assassinated has the ISO 8601 lexical representation
-0043-03-13, but will be formatted as 15 March 44 BCE in the Julian calendar
or 13 March 44 BCE in the Gregorian calendar (dependant on the chosen
localization of the names of months and eras).</p></note><p>The intended use of the <code>$place</code> argument is to identify
 the place where an event
represented by the <code>dateTime</code>, <code>date</code>,
or <code>time</code> supplied in the <code>$value</code> argument took place or will take place.
                  If the <code>$place</code> argument is omitted or is set
                  to an empty sequence, then the default place defined in the dynamic context is used.
If the value is supplied, and is not the empty sequence, then it <rfc2119>should</rfc2119> 
                  either be a country code or an <phrase diff="chg" at="E">IANA</phrase> timezone name.
               If the value does not take this form, or if its value is not recognized

      and "jp" for Japan. Implementations <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> also allow the use

countries from ISO 3166-3</p></item><item><p><phrase diff="chg" at="E">IANA</phrase> timezone names are defined in the <phrase diff="chg" at="E">IANA</phrase> timezone database <bibref ref="olson"/>.

for whom the date or time is being formatted;
that should be done by means of the <code>$language</code> attribute. 
This information 
<rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be used to provide additional information when converting dates between
calendars or when deciding how individual components of the date and time are to be formatted. 
For example, different countries using the Old Style (Julian) calendar started the new year on different
days, and some countries used variants of the calendar that were out of synchronization as a result of
differences in calculating leap years.</p><p>The geographical area identified by a country code is defined by the
  boundaries as they existed at the time of the date to be formatted,
  or the present-day boundaries for dates in the future.</p><p>If the <code>$place</code> argument is supplied in the form
                  of an <phrase diff="chg" at="E">IANA</phrase> timezone name that is recognized by the implementation, then the date or
               time being formatted is adjusted to the timezone offset applicable in that timezone.
               For example, if the <code>xs:dateTime</code> value <code>2010-02-15T12:00:00Z</code>
                  is formatted with the <code>$place</code> argument set to
                  <code>America/New_York</code>, then the output will be as if the value
                  <code>2010-02-15T07:00:00-05:00</code> had been supplied. This adjustment takes daylight
                  savings time into account where possible; if the date in question falls during
                  daylight savings time in New York, then it is adjusted to timezone offset <code>-PT4H</code>
                  rather than <code>-PT5H</code>. Adjustment using daylight savings time is only possible
                  where the value includes a date, and where the date is within the range covered
                  by the timezone database.</p></div4></div3><div3 id="date-time-examples"><head>Examples of date and time formatting</head><p>The following examples show a selection of dates and times and the way they might

                    <code>fn:exactly-one</code> defined in this section, check that the cardinality
                    of a sequence is in the expected range. They are particularly useful with regard
                    to static typing. For example, the function call <code>fn:remove($seq, fn:index-of($seq2, 'abc'))</code>
                    requires the result of the call on <code>fn:index-of</code> to be a singleton integer, 
                    but the static type system cannot infer this; writing the expression as 
                    <code>fn:remove($seq, fn:exactly-one(fn:index-of($seq2, 'abc')))</code> 
                    will provide a suitable static type at query analysis time, and ensures that the length of the sequence is
                    correct with a dynamic check at query execution time.</p><p>The type signatures for these functions deliberately declare the argument type as
                    <code>item()*</code>, permitting a sequence of any length. A more restrictive
                    signature would defeat the purpose of the function, which is to defer
                    cardinality checking until query execution time.</p><div3 id="func-zero-or-one"><head>fn:zero-or-one</head><glist><gitem><label>Summary</label><def>

            that has the <code>is-id</code> property, whereas it would be more appropriate to return
            its parent, that being the element that is uniquely identified by the ID. A new function
               <code>fn:element-with-id</code> has been introduced with the desired

         <p role="note"> An element may have more than one <code>ID</code> value. This can occur with synthetic

         <p role="note"> An element or attribute typically acquires the <code>is-idrefs</code> property by being

               <code>IDREFS</code> in a DTD.</p>
         <p role="note">Because the function is sensitive to the way in which the data model

         <p role="note"> No error is raised in respect of a candidate <code>ID</code> value that does not match
            the <code>IDREF</code> value of any element or attribute in the document. If no

         <p role="note"> It is possible for two or more nodes to have an <code>IDREF</code> value that matches a

         <p role="note">If the data model is constructed from a PSVI, the typed value of a node that has the

            configurable machinery for locating resources and turning their contents into document
            nodes within the XPath data model. Both the set of resources that are reachable, and the
            mechanisms by which those resources are parsed and validated, are <termref def="implementation-dependent">implementation-dependent</termref>.</p>
         <p> One possible processing model for this function is as follows. The resource identified
            by the URI Reference is retrieved. If the resource cannot be retrieved, a dynamic error
            is raised <errorref class="DC" code="0002"/>. The data resulting from the retrieval
            action is then parsed as an XML document and a tree is constructed in accordance with
            the <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-30"/>. If the top-level media type is known and is
            "text", the content is parsed in the same way as if the media type were text/xml;
            otherwise, it is parsed in the same way as if the media type were application/xml. If
            the contents cannot be parsed successfully, a dynamic error is raised <errorref class="DC" code="0002"/>. Otherwise, the result of the function is the document node
            at the root of the resulting tree. This tree is then optionally validated against a
            schema.</p>

         <p role="note">In earlier releases, the primary use for the <code>fn:collection</code> function

         system filestore, or perhaps held in an XML database. In this release the concept has
         been generalised to allow other resources to be retrieved: for example JSON documents might
         be returned as arrays or maps, non-XML text files might be returned as strings, and binary
         files might be returned as instances of <code>xs:base64Binary</code>.</p>
         <p role="note">The abstract concept of a collection might be realized in different ways by different

            Specifying resources using URIs is

         For example, a collection might return XML documents, and the corresponding URI collection might return
         the URIs of those documents. However, this specification does not impose such a close relationship. For example, there
         may be collection URIs accepted by one of the two functions and not by the other; a collection might contain
         items that do not have any URI; or a URI collection might contain URIs that cannot be dereferenced to return any 
         resource.</p>
         
         <p role="note">Thus, some implementations might ensure that calling <code>fn:uri-collection</code> and then

            calling <code>fn:collection</code> with the same argument; however, this is not
            guaranteed.</p>
         
         <p role="note">In the case where <code>fn:uri-collection</code> returns the URIs of resources that
            could also be retrieved directly using <code>fn:collection</code>, there are several reasons why it 
            might be appropriate to use this function in preference
            to the <code>fn:collection</code> function. For example:</p>

         <ulist role="note">
            <item>
               <p>It allows different URIs for different kinds of resource to be dereferenced in
                  different ways: for
                  example, the returned URIs might be referenced using the
                     <code>fn:unparsed-text</code> function rather than the <code>fn:doc</code>
                  function.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>In XSLT 3.0 it allows the documents in a collection to be processed in streaming mode using the

            </item>
            <item>
               <p>It allows recovery from failures to read, parse, or validate individual documents,
                  by calling the <code>fn:doc</code> (or other dereferencing) function within the scope of try/catch.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>It allows selection of which documents to read based on their URI, for example
                  they can be filtered to select those whose URIs end in <code>.xml</code>, or those
                  that use the <code>https</code> scheme.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>An application might choose to limit the number of URIs processed in a single run,
                  for example it might process only the first 50 URIs in the collection; or it might
                  present the URIs to the user and allow the user to select which of them need to be
                  further processed.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>It allows the URIs to be modified before they are dereferenced, for example by
                  adding or removing query parameters, or by redirecting the request to a local
                  cache or to a mirror site.</p>
            </item>
         </ulist>

         <p role="note">For some of these use cases, this assumes that the cost of calling

            retrieving all the documents in the collection over the network and parsing them). This

            are use cases for this function where the retrieved text is to be included as unparsed
            XML within a CDATA section of a containing document, and because processors are likely

            the string is serialized as XML or HTML. If these characters actually represent markup
            (for example, if the text file contains HTML), then an XSLT stylesheet can attempt to
            write them as markup to the output file using the <code>disable-output-escaping</code>
            attribute of the <code>xsl:value-of</code> instruction. Note, however, that XSLT

         <p role="note">On many platforms, the term "environment variable" has a natural meaning in terms of

            exclude other interpretations, such as a mapping to a set of configuration parameters in
            a database system.</p>
         <p role="note">Environment variable names are usually case sensitive. Names are usually of the form
               <code>(letter|_) (letter|_|digit)*</code>, but this varies by platform.</p>
         <p role="note">On some platforms, there may sometimes be multiple environment variables with the same
            name; in this case, it is implementation-dependent as to which is returned; see for
            example <bibref ref="POSIX.1-2008"/> (Chapter 8, Environment Variables). Implementations
               <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> use prefixes or other naming conventions to disambiguate the
            names.</p>
         <p role="note">The requirement to ensure that the function is deterministic means in practice that the

            execution, and return values obtained from this snapshot, rather than using live values
            that are subject to change at any time.</p>
         <p role="note">Operating system environment variables may be associated with a particular process,
            while queries and stylesheets may execute across multiple processes (or multiple
            machines). In such circumstances implementations <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> choose to

         <p role="note">Since the XML document is presented to the parser as a string, rather than as a sequence
            of octets, the encoding specified within the XML declaration has no meaning. If the XML
            parser accepts input only in the form of a sequence of octets, then the processor must
            ensure that the string is encoded as octets in a way that is consistent with rules used
            by the XML parser to detect the encoding.</p>
         <p role="note">The primary use case for this function is to handle input documents that contain nested
            XML documents embedded within CDATA sections. Since the content of the CDATA section are
            exposed as text, the receiving query or stylesheet may pass this text to the
               <code>fn:parse-xml</code> function to create a tree representation of the nested
            document.</p>
         <p role="note">Similarly, nested XML within comments is sometimes encountered, and lexical XML is
            sometimes returned by extension functions, for example, functions that access web
            services or read from databases.</p>
         <p role="note">A use case arises in XSLT where there is a need to preprocess an input document before
            parsing. For example, an application might wish to edit the document to remove its
            DOCTYPE declaration. This can be done by reading the raw text using the
               <code>fn:unparsed-text</code> function, editing the resulting string, and then
            passing it to the <code>fn:parse-xml</code> function.</p>

         <p role="note">The main differences between <code>fn:parse-xml</code> and
               <code>fn:parse-xml-fragment</code> are that for <code>fn:parse-xml</code>, the
            children of the resulting document node must contain exactly one element node and no
            text nodes, wheras for <code>fn:parse-xml-fragment</code>, the resulting document node
            can have any number (including zero) of element and text nodes among its children. An
            additional difference is that the <emph>text declaration</emph> at the start of an
            external entity has slightly different syntax from the <emph>XML declaration</emph> at
            the start of a well-formed document.</p>
         <p role="note">Note that all whitespace outside the <emph>text declaration</emph> is significant,
            including whitespace that precedes the first element node.</p>
         <p role="note">One use case for this function is to handle XML fragments stored in databases, which
            frequently allow zero-or-more top level element nodes. Another use case is to parse the

               returns a newly created document node, having two elements named <code>alpha</code>
               and <code>beta</code> as its children; each of these elements in turn is the parent
               of a text node.</p>
            <p>The expression <code>fn:parse-xml-fragment("He was &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; kind")</code>
               returns a newly created document node having three children: a text node whose string
               value is <code>"He was "</code>, an element node named <code>i</code> having a child
               text node with string value <code>"so"</code>, and a text node whose string value is
                  <code>" kind"</code>.</p>

               declaration that appears at the start of an external general parsed entity. (Thus, it

         <p>A type error <xerrorref spec="XP" class="TY" code="0004"/> occurs if the second argument
            is present and does not match either of the types <code>element(output:serialization-parameters)?</code>
         or <code>map(*)</code>.</p>
         <note><p>This is defined as a type error so that it can be enforced via the function signature by implementations
         that generalize the type system in a suitable way.</p></note>
         <p>If the host language makes serialization an optional feature and the implementation does
            not support serialization, then a dynamic error <errorref class="DC" code="0010"/> is
            raised.</p>
         <p>The serialization process will raise an error if <code>$arg</code> is an attribute or
            namespace node.</p>
         <p>When the second argument is supplied as a map, 
            and the supplied value is of the wrong type for the particular parameter, for example if the value of <code>indent</code>
         is a string rather than a boolean, then as defined by the <termref def="option-parameter-conventions">option parameter conventions</termref>,
         a type error <xerrorref spec="XP" class="TY" code="0004"/> is raised. 
         If the value is of the correct type, but does not satisfy the rules for that
         parameter defined in <bibref ref="xslt-xquery-serialization-31"/>, then a dynamic error 
         <xerrorref spec="SER31" class="PM" code="0016"/> is raised. (For example, this occurs if the map supplied to
         <code>use-character-maps</code> includes a key that is a string whose length is not one (1)).</p>
         <p>If any serialization error occurs, including the detection of an invalid value for a
            serialization parameter as described above, this results in the <code>fn:serialize</code> call failing with
            a dynamic error.</p>

         <p role="note">One use case for this function arises when there is a need to construct an XML document
            containing nested XML documents within a CDATA section (or on occasions within a
            comment). See <code>fn:parse-xml</code> for further details.</p>
         <p role="note">Another use case arises when there is a need to call an extension function that expects
            a lexical XML document as input.</p>
         <p role="note">There are also use cases where the application wants to post-process the output of a
            query or transformation, for example by adding an internal DTD subset, or by inserting
            proprietary markup delimiters such as the <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> used by some
            templating languages.</p>
         <p role="note">The ability to specify the serialization parameters in an <code>output:serialization-parameters</code>
         element provides backwards compatibility with the 3.0 version of this specification; the ability to
         use a map takes advantage of new features in the 3.1 version. The default parameter values are
         implementation-defined when an <code>output:serialization-parameters</code>
            element is used (or when the argument is omitted), but are fixed by this specification in the
         case where a map (including an empty map) is supplied for the argument.</p>

         <p>A call to <code>fn:function-lookup</code> returns the function obtained by looking up
            the expanded QName supplied as <code>$name</code> and the arity supplied as
               <code>$arity</code> in the named functions component of the dynamic context
            (specifically, the dynamic context of the call to <code>fn:function-lookup</code>).</p>

         <p>Furthermore, if that function has an implementation-dependent implementation (see note
            below), then the implementation of the function returned by
               <code>fn:function-lookup</code> is associated with the static and dynamic context of
            the call to <code>fn:function-lookup</code>.</p>

         <note>
            <p>The above rule deliberately uses the same wording as the corresponding rule for Named
               Function References. The term "a function [with] an implementation-dependent
               implementation" essentially means a function whose implementation is provided by the
               language processor rather than by the stylesheet or query author. This rule is
               therefore relevant to built-in functions and vendor-supplied extension functions
               whose result depends on the context of the function call.</p>
         </note>



         <p>Otherwise (if no known function can be identified by name and arity), an empty sequence
            is returned.</p>

         <p>If the arguments to <code>fn:function-lookup</code> identify a function that is present
            in the static context of the function call, the function will always return the same
            function that a static reference to this function would bind to. If there is no such
            function in the static context, then the results depend on what is present in the
            dynamic context, which is <termref def="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>.</p>

         <p role="note">This function can be useful where there is a need to make a dynamic decision on which of
            several statically-known functions to call. It can thus be used as a substitute for
            polymorphism, in the case where the application has been designed so several functions
            implement the same interface.</p>
         <p role="note">The function can also be useful in cases where a query or stylesheet module is written
            to work with alternative versions of a library module. In such cases the author of the
            main module might wish to test whether an imported library module contains or does not
            contain a particular function, and to call a function in that module only if it is
            available in the version that was imported. A static call would cause a static error if
            the function is not available, whereas getting the function using
               <code>fn:function-lookup</code> allows the caller to take fallback action in this
            situation. </p>
         <p role="note">If the function that is retrieved by <code>fn:function-lookup</code> is <termref def="dt-context-dependent">context-dependent</termref>, that is, if it has
            dependencies on the static or dynamic context of its caller, the context that applies is
            the static and/or dynamic context of the call to the <code>fn:function-lookup</code>
            function itself. The context thus effectively forms part of the closure of the returned
            function. In practice this applies only where the target of
               <code>fn:function-lookup</code> is a built-in function, because user-defined
            functions never depend on the static or dynamic context of the function call. The rule
            applies recursively, since <code>fn:function-lookup</code> is itself a context-dependent
            built-in function. </p>
         <p role="note">These specifications do not define any circumstances in which the dynamic context will
            contain functions that are not present in the static context, but neither do they rule
            this out. For example an API <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> provide the ability to add functions
            to the dynamic context. Equally, these specifications do not define any mechanism for
            creating context-dependent functions other than the built-in context-dependent
            functions, but neither do they rule out the existence of such functions. </p>
         <p role="note">The mere fact that a function exists and has a name does not of itself mean that the
         function is present in the dynamic context. For example, functions obtained through
         use of the <code>fn:load-xquery-module</code> function are not added to the dynamic context.</p>

         <p>If a static or dynamic error is reported by the XSLT processor, this function fails with a dynamic error, retaining the XSLT error code.</p>
         <p>A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="XT" code="0003" type="dynamic"/> if the XSLT transformation invoked by a call on

         <note><p>XSLT 1.0 does not define any error codes, so this is the likely outcome with an XSLT 1.0 processor. XSLT 2.0 and 3.0 do
         define error codes, but some APIs do not expose them. If multiple errors are signaled by the transformation (which is most likely
         to happen with static errors) then the error code should where possible be that of one of these errors, chosen arbitrarily; the processor
         may make details of additional errors available to the application in an <termref def="dt-implementation-defined">implementation-defined</termref>
         way.</p></note>
         <p>A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="XT" code="0004" type="dynamic"/> if the use of this function (or of selected options)
            has been externally disabled, for example for security reasons.</p>
         <p diff="del" at="G">A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="XT" code="0005" type="dynamic"/> if <code>delivery-format</code> is <code>saved</code>

               returns true.</termdef></p><p>It is not necessary that all the keys in a map should be
               of the same type (for example, they can include a mixture of integers and strings).</p><p diff="del" at="D">A map cannot contain among its keys both date/time values with a timezone and date/time values with no timezone. The term "date/time value"
               here means an instance of any of the types <code>xs:dateTime</code>, <code>xs:date</code>, <code>xs:time</code>, <code>xs:gYear</code>
               <code>xs:gYearMonth</code>, <code>xs:gMonth</code>, <code>xs:gMonthDay</code>, or <code>xs:gDay</code>. If a map contains such a value
               with a timezone, then adding an entry with no timezone results in a dynamic error; and conversely, if a map contains such a value
               with no timezone, then adding an entry with a timezone results in a dynamic error.</p><note diff="del" at="D"><p>The reason for this rule is that comparison of a date/time value with timezone to one without timezone depends on knowing the
               implicit timezone. If values with timezones and values without timezones could be mixed in the same map, such a map could become invalid
               when the implicit timezone changes. The rule therefore ensures that the constraint that no two entries have the <termref def="dt-same-key"/>
               applies regardless what timezone is used for the assessment.</p></note><p>As with all other values, the functions in this specification treat maps as immutable. 
               For example, the <code>map:remove</code> function <phrase diff="chg" at="C">returns a map that differs
                  from the supplied map by the omission (typically) of one entry, but the supplied map is not changed by the operation.
               Two calls on <code>map:remove</code> with the same arguments return maps that are
               indistinguishable from each other; there is no way of asking whether these are "the same map".</phrase></p><p>The function call <code>map:get($map, $key)</code> can be used to retrieve the value associated with a given key.</p><p>A map can also be viewed as a function from keys to associated values. To achieve this, a map is also a 
               function item. The function corresponding to the map has the signature 
               <code>function($key as xs:anyAtomicValue) as item()*</code>. Calling the function has the same effect as calling
               the <code>get</code> function: the expression
               <code>$map($key)</code> returns the same result as <code>get($map, $key)</code>. For example, if <code>$books-by-isbn</code>
               is a map whose keys are ISBNs and whose assocated values are <code>book</code> elements, then the expression
               <code>$books-by-isbn("0470192747")</code> returns the <code>book</code> element with the given ISBN.
               The fact that a map is a function item allows it to be passed as an argument to higher-order functions 
               that expect a function item as one of their arguments.</p><p>There is no operation to atomize a map or convert it to a string. The function <code>fn:serialize</code> can in some cases
            be used to produce a JSON representation of a map.</p><table class="index"><thead><tr><th>Function</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">op:same-key</code></td><td>Determines whether two atomic values can coexist as separate keys within a map.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">map:merge</code></td><td>Returns a map that combines the entries from a number of existing maps.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">map:size</code></td><td>Returns the number of entries in the supplied map.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">map:keys</code></td><td>Returns a sequence containing all the keys present in a map</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">map:contains</code></td><td>Tests whether a supplied map contains an entry for a given key</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">map:get</code></td><td>Returns the value associated with a supplied key in a given map.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap; vertical-align:top"><code style="padding-right: 10px">map:find</code></td><td>Searches the supplied input sequence and any contained maps and arrays for a map entry with the supplied key,

         <note>
            <p>By way of explanation, <code>$combine-maps</code> is a function that combines
            two maps by iterating over the keys of the second map, adding each key and its corresponding
            value to the first map as it proceeds. The second call of <code>fn:fold-left</code>
            in the <code>return</code> clause then iterates over the maps supplied in the call
            to <code>map:merge</code>, accumulating a single map that absorbs successive maps
            in the input sequence by calling <code>$combine-maps</code>.</p>
         
       
        <p>This algorithm processes the supplied maps in a defined order, but processes the keys within
         each map in implementation-dependent order.</p>
         
         <p>The use of <code>fn:random-number-generator</code> represents one possible conformant
         implementation for <code>"duplicates":"use-any"</code>, but it is not the only conformant
         implementation and is not intended to be a realistic implementation. The purpose of this
         option is to allow the implementation to use whatever strategy is most efficient; for example,
         if the input maps are processed in parallel, then specifying <code>"duplicates":"use-any"</code>
         means that the implementation does not need to keep track of the original order of the sequence of input
         maps.</p>

               sequence; <code>fn:function-arity</code> always returns <code>1</code>.</p><p>Maps may be compared using the <code>fn:deep-equal</code> function.</p><p>There is no function or operator to atomize a map or convert it to a string (other than <code>fn:serialize</code>,
               which can be used to serialize some maps as JSON texts).</p></div2><div2 id="array-functions"><head>Functions that Operate on Arrays</head><p>An array is an additional kind of item. An array of size <var>N</var> is a mapping from the integers
            (1 to <var>N</var>) to a set of values, called the members of the array, each of which is an arbitrary
            sequence. Because an array is an item, and therefore a sequence, arrays can be nested.</p><p>The functions defined in this section use a conventional namespace prefix <code>array</code>, which
               is assumed to be bound to the namespace URI <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/array</code>.</p><p diff="chg" at="C">As with all other values, arrays are treated as immutable. 
               For example, the <code>array:reverse</code> function returns an array that differs from the supplied
               array in the order of its members, but the supplied array is not changed by the operation. Two calls
               on <code>array:reverse</code> with the same argument will return arrays that are indistinguishable from
               each other; there is no way of asking whether these are "the same array". Like sequences, arrays have no identity. </p><p>An array acts as a function from integer positions to associated values, so the
               function call <code>$array($index)</code> can be used to retrieve the array member at a given position.
               The function corresponding to the array has the signature 
               <code>function($index as xs:integer) as item()*</code>. 
               The fact that an array is a function item allows it to be passed as an argument to higher-order functions 
               that expect a function item as one of their arguments.</p><p>In the function definitions that follow, all the array functions are defined in terms of five primitives:</p><ulist><item><p><code>[]</code> represents the zero-length array (an array with no members).</p></item><item><p><code>$array($index)</code> returns the member at position <code>$index</code>.</p></item><item><p><code>array:size($array)</code> returns the number of members in the array.</p></item><item><p><code>op:array-singleton($seq)</code> returns an array of size one whose single member

                     This section describes facilities
                     allowing JSON data to be converted to and from XDM values.</p><p diff="add" at="D">This specification describes two ways of representing JSON data losslessly
                using XDM constructs. The first method uses XDM maps to represent JSON objects, and XDM arrays to
                represent JSON arrays. The second method represents all JSON constructs using XDM element and attribute nodes.</p><p diff="del" at="D">A number of mappings between JSON structures and XML documents have been proposed. Some of these
                  are lossless but complex; others are simpler but lose information. Because none of these mappings
                  is ideal in all circumstances, this specification does not define such a mapping, and instead converts
                  JSON structures losslessly to XDM maps and atomic values, which can then be further converted
                  to XML trees in any desired representation using XQuery or XSLT node construction operations.</p><div3 id="json-to-maps-and-arrays"><head>Representing JSON using maps and arrays</head><p>This section defines a mapping from JSON data to XDM maps and arrays. Two functions are available 
                   to support this mapping: <code>fn:parse-json</code> and <code>fn:serialize</code> (with options
                     selecting JSON as the output method).
                  The <code>fn:parse-json</code> function will accept any JSON text as input, and converts it 
                  to XDM data values. The <code>fn:serialize</code> function (with JSON as the output method) will accept any XDM
                  value produced using <code>fn:parse-json</code> and convert it back to the original JSON text
                  (subject to insignificant variations such as reordering the properties in a JSON object). </p><note diff="add" at="D"><p>The conversion is lossless if recommended JSON good practice is followed. Information may however be lost if
                   (a) JSON numbers are not exactly representable as double-precision floating point, or (b) duplicate key
                   values appear within a JSON object.</p></note><p>The representation of JSON data produced by the <code>fn:parse-json</code> function
                      has been chosen with ease of manipulation as a design aim. For example, a simple JSON object
                      such as <code>{"Sun":1, "Mon":2, "Tue":3, ...}</code> produces a simple map, so if the result
                      of parsing is held in <code>$weekdays</code>, the number for a given weekday can be extracted
                      using an expression such as <code>$weekdays?Tue</code>. Similarly, a simple array such as
                      <code>["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", ...]</code> produces an array that can be addressed as, for example,
                      <code>$weekdays(3)</code>. A more deeply nested structure can be addressed in a similar way:
                      for example if the JSON text is an array of person objects, each of which has a property named 
                      "phones" which is an array of strings containing phone numbers, then the first phone number of
                      each person in the data can be addressed as <code>$data?phones(1)</code>.</p></div3><div3 id="json-to-xml-mapping"><head>XML Representation of JSON</head><p>This section defines a mapping from JSON data to XML (specifically, to XDM element and attribute nodes). A
                  function <code>fn:json-to-xml</code> is provided to take a JSON string as input and convert it
                  to the XML representation, and a second function <code>fn:xml-to-json</code> performs the reverse operation.</p><p>The XML representation is designed to be capable of representing any valid JSON text including
                  one that uses characters which are not valid in XML. The transformation is normally lossless: that is,
                  distinct JSON texts convert to distinct XML representations. When converting JSON to XML, options are provided
                  to reject unsupported characters, to replace them with a substitute character, or to leave them in
                  backslash-escaped form.</p><note><p>The conversion is lossless if recommended JSON good practice is followed. Information may however be lost if

                a constructor functions for the new datatype <code>xs:dateTimeStamp</code> introduced in <bibref ref="xmlschema11-2"/>.</p><p>
A constructor function is not defined for <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code> as there are no atomic values with type annotation <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code> at runtime, although this can be a statically inferred type.
A constructor function is not defined for <code>xs:NOTATION</code> since it is defined as an abstract type in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>.  If the static context (See <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="static_context"/>) contains a type derived from
<code>xs:NOTATION</code> then a constructor function is defined for it.
See <specref ref="constructor-functions-for-user-defined-types"/>.

The form of the constructor function for an atomic type
                    <emph>eg:TYPE</emph> is:</p><example role="signature"><proto name="TYPE" prefix="eg" return-type="eg:TYPE" role="example" returnEmptyOk="yes" isSpecial="yes" returnSeq="no" returnVaries="no" isSchema="no" isDatatype="no" isOp="no"><arg name="arg" type="xs:anyAtomicType" emptyOk="yes"/></proto></example><p>If <code>$arg</code> is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned. For
                    example, the signature of the constructor function corresponding to the
                    <code>xs:unsignedInt</code> type defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> is:</p><example role="signature"><proto name="unsignedInt" return-type="xs:unsignedInt" isSchema="yes" prefix="xs" returnEmptyOk="yes" role="example" returnSeq="no" returnVaries="no" isDatatype="no" isSpecial="no" isOp="no"><arg name="arg" type="xs:anyAtomicType" emptyOk="yes"/></proto></example><p>Calling the constructor function <code>xs:unsignedInt(12)</code> returns
                    the <code> xs:unsignedInt</code> value 12. Another call of that constructor
                    function that returns the same <code>xs:unsignedInt</code> value is
                    <code>xs:unsignedInt("12")</code>. The same result would also be returned if the
                    constructor function were to be called with a node that had a typed value equal
                    to the <code>xs:unsignedInt</code> 12. The standard features described in
                        <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-atomization"/> would atomize the node to
                    extract its typed value and then call the constructor with that value. If the
                    value passed to a constructor is not in the lexical space of the datatype to be constructed, 
                    and cannot be converted to a value in the value space of the datatype under the rules in this
                    specification, then an
                   dynamic error is raised <errorref class="RG" code="0001"/>.</p><p>The semantics of the constructor function 
                        <code>xs:TYPE(arg)</code>

                    . See <specref ref="casting"/>.</p><p>If the argument to a constructor function is a literal, the result of the

Values cannot belong directly to the type <code>xs:NOTATION</code>, only to its subtypes.
</p></item><item><p>
The lexical representation of these types uses namespace prefixes, whose
meaning is context-dependent.</p></item></ulist><p>
These constraints result in the following rules:</p><olist><item><p>
There is no constructor function for <code>xs:NOTATION</code>. Constructors are defined, however, for <code>xs:QName</code>, 
   for types derived or constructed from <code>xs:QName</code>, and for types 
   derived or constructed from <code>xs:NOTATION</code>.
</p></item><item><p>When converting from an <code>xs:string</code>, the prefix within the lexical 
      <code>xs:QName</code> supplied
      as the argument is resolved to a namespace URI using the statically known
      namespaces from the static context. If the lexical <code>xs:QName</code>
      has no prefix, the
      namespace URI of the resulting expanded-QName is the default element/type
      namespace from the static context. Components of the static context are
      defined in <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="static_context"/>. A dynamic error is raised <errorref class="NS" code="0004"/>
      if the prefix is not bound in the static context. As described in
      <xspecref spec="DM31" ref="terminology"/>, the supplied prefix is retained as part of the
      expanded-QName value.</p></item></olist><p>When a constructor function for a namespace-sensitive type is used as a literal function item
      or in a partial function application (for example, <code>xs:QName#1</code> or <code>xs:QName(?)</code>) the namespace
      bindings that are relevant are those from the static context of the literal function item or partial function application.
      When a constructor function for a namespace-sensitive type is obtained by means of the <code>fn:function-lookup</code>
      function, the relevant namespace bindings are those from the static context of the call on <code>fn:function-lookup</code>.</p><note><p>When the supplied argument to the <code>xs:QName</code> constructor
   function is a node, the node is atomized in the usual way, and if the result is <code>xs:untypedAtomic</code> it is then
   converted as if a string had been supplied. The effect might not be what is desired.
   For example, given the attribute <code>xsi:type="my:type"</code>, the expression 
   <code>xs:QName(@xsi:type)</code> might fail on the grounds that the prefix <code>my</code>
   is undeclared. This is because the namespace bindings are taken from the static context
   (that is, from the query or stylesheet), and not from the source document containing the
   <code>@xsi:type</code> attribute. The solution to this problem is to use the function call
   <code>resolve-QName(@xsi:type, .)</code> instead.</p></note></div2><div2 id="constructor-functions-for-xsd-list-types"><head>Constructor functions for XML Schema built-in list types</head><p>Each of the three built-in list

                    constructor function whose name is the same as the name of the type and whose
                    effect is to create a value of that type from the supplied argument. The rules
                    for constructing user-defined types are defined in the same way as the rules for
                    constructing built-in derived types defined in <specref ref="constructor-functions-for-xsd-types"/>. </p><p>
                            Special rules apply to constructor functions for namespace-sensitive types, that is,
                            atomic types derived from <code>xs:QName</code> and <code>xs:NOTATION</code>, list types that have
   a namespace-sensitive item type, and union types that have a namespace-sensitive member type. See <specref ref="constructor-qname-notation"/>.</p><p>Consider a situation where the static context contains an atomic type
                    called <code>hatSize</code> defined in a schema whose target namespace is bound
                    to the prefix <code>eg</code>. In such a case the following constructor function is available to users:</p><example role="signature"><proto prefix="eg" name="hatSize" return-type="my:hatSize" isSpecial="yes" returnEmptyOk="yes" role="example" returnSeq="no" returnVaries="no" isSchema="no" isDatatype="no" isOp="no"><arg name="arg" type="xs:anyAtomicType" emptyOk="yes"/></proto></example><p>In the case of an atomic type <var>A</var>, the return type of the function is <code>A?</code>, reflecting
               the fact that the result will be an empty sequence if the input is an empty sequence. For a union or list type,
               the return type of the function is specified only as <code>xs:anyAtomicType*</code>. Implementations performing
               static type checking will often be able to compute a more specific result type. For example, if the target type
               is a list type whose item type is the atomic type <var>A</var>, the result will always be an instance of <var>A*</var>;
               if the target type is a pure union type <var>U</var> then the result will always be an instance of <var>U?</var>.
               In general, however, applications needing interoperable behavior on implementations that do strict static type
               checking will need to use a <code>treat as</code> expression to assert the specific type of the result.</p><p> To construct an instance of a user-defined type 
                  that is not in a namespace, it is <phrase diff="add" at="D">possible to use an
                  <code>EQName</code> (for example <code>Q{}hatsize(17)</code>). Alternatives are</phrase>
                    to use a cast expression (<code>17 cast as hatsize</code>) or <phrase>(if the host language allows it)</phrase> 
                  to undeclare the default function namespace. </p></div2></div1><div1 id="casting"><head>Casting</head><p> Constructor functions and cast expressions accept an expression and return a value
                of a given type. They both convert a source value, <emph>SV</emph>, of a source type,

                <emph>TT</emph>, with identical semantics and different syntax. The name of the
                constructor function is the same as the name of the built-in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/> 
                datatype or the datatype defined in <xspecref spec="DM31" ref="types"/>
                   of <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"/> (see <specref ref="constructor-functions-for-xsd-types"/>) or the user-derived datatype

                target for the conversion, and the semantics are exactly the same as for a cast
                expression; for example,
                    <code>xs:date("2003-01-01")</code>
                 means exactly the same as

                See <xspecref spec="XP31" ref="id-cast"/>. If the type name allows the empty sequence
                and the expression to be cast is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned.
                If the type name does not allow the empty sequence and the expression to be cast is
                the empty sequence, a type error is raised <xerrorref spec="XP" class="TY" code="0004" type="type"/>.</p><p>Where the argument to a cast is a literal, the result of the function <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> be

               is an instance of <code>xs:string</code> or <code>xs:untypedAtomic</code>,
               including types derived from these by restriction. If the value is
               <code>xs:untypedAtomic</code>, it is treated in exactly the same way as a
               string containing the same sequence of characters.</p><p>The supplied string is mapped to a typed value of the target type as defined in <bibref ref="xmlschema-2"/>. 
               Whitespace normalization is applied as indicated by the
               <code>whiteSpace</code> facet for the datatype. The resulting whitespace-normalized string 
               must be a valid lexical form for the datatype.  The semantics of casting follow the rules of
               XML Schema validation.  For example, <code>"13" cast as xs:unsignedInt</code> returns 
               the <code>xs:unsignedInt</code> typed 
               value <code>13</code>. This could also be written <code>xs:unsignedInt("13")</code>.</p><p>The target type can be any simple type other than an
               abstract type. Specifically, it can be a type whose variety is atomic, union, or list.
               In each case the effect of casting to the target type is the same as constructing an element
               with the supplied value as its content, validating the element using the target type as
               the governing type, and atomizing the element to obtain its typed value.</p><p>When the target type is a derived type that is restricted by a pattern facet, the
               lexical form is first checked against the pattern before further casting
               is attempted (See <specref ref="casting-to-derived-types"/>).  If the lexical form does
               not conform to the pattern, a dynamic 
               error <errorref class="RG" code="0001" type="dynamic"/> is raised.</p><p>For example, consider a user-defined type <code>my:boolean</code> which is derived by
               restriction from <code>xs:boolean</code> and specifies the pattern facet <code>value="0|1"</code>.
               The expression <code>"true" cast as my:boolean</code> would fail with a dynamic
               error <errorref class="RG" code="0001" type="dynamic"/>.</p><p>Facets other than <code>pattern</code> are checked <emph>after</emph> the conversion.
               For example if there is a user-defined datatype called <code>my:height</code> 
               defined as a restriction of <code>xs:integer</code> with the facet <code>&lt;maxInclusive value="84"/&gt;</code>,
               then the expression <code>"100" cast as my:height</code> would fail with a dynamic
               error <errorref class="RG" code="0001" type="dynamic"/>.</p><p>Casting to the types <code>xs:NOTATION</code>, <code>xs:anySimpleType</code>, 
               or <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code> is not permitted because these types are abstract (they have
               no immediate instances).</p><p>Special rules apply when casting to namespace-sensitive types. The types <code>xs:QName</code>
               and <code>xs:NOTATION</code> are namespace-sensitive. Any type derived by restriction from 
               a namespace-sensitive type is itself namespace-sensitive, as is any union type having a
               namespace-sensitive type among its members, and any list type having a namespace-sensitive type
               as its item type. For details, see <specref ref="constructor-qname-notation"/>.</p><note><p>This version of the specification allows casting between <code>xs:QName</code>
               and <code>xs:NOTATION</code> in either direction; this was not permitted in the previous Recommendation. This version also removes
               the rule that only a string literal (rather than a dynamic string) may be cast to an <code>xs:QName</code></p></note><p>When casting to a numeric type:</p><ulist><item><p>If the value is too large or too small to be accurately represented by the implementation,

                  However, if the implementation is reliant on an implementation of XML Schema 1.0 in which negative zero

                  <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions</code>, namely <code role="example">fn:put</code>. This function can be used
               to write a document to external storage. It is thus unusual in that it has side-effects; the XQuery Update 1.0
               specification defines semantics for updating expressions including this function.</p><p>Although XQuery Update 1.0 is defined as an extension of XQuery 1.0, a number of implementors have adapted it,
               in a fairly intuitive way, to work with later versions of XQuery. At the time of this publication, later versions of the
               XQuery Update specification remain at Working Draft status.</p></div3></div2><div2 id="functions-defined-by-community-groups" diff="add" at="E"><head>Functions Defined by Community Groups</head><p>A number of community groups, with varying levels of formal organization, have defined specifications for
            additional function libraries to augment the core functions defined in this specification. Many of the resulting
            function specifications have implementations available for popular XPath, XQuery, and XSLT processors, though
            the level of support is highly variable.</p><p>The first such group was EXSLT. This activity was primarily concerned with augmenting the capability of
            XSLT 1.0, and many of its specifications were overtaken by core functions that became available in XPath 2.0.
            EXSLT defined a number of function modules covering:</p><slist><sitem>Dates and Times</sitem><sitem>Dynamic XPath Evaluation</sitem><sitem>Common (containing most notably the widely-used <code>node-set</code> function)</sitem><sitem>Math (<code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>abs</code>, and trigonometric functions)</sitem><sitem>Random Number Generation</sitem><sitem>Regular Expressions</sitem><sitem>Sets (operations on sets of nodes including set intersection and difference)</sitem><sitem>String Manipulation (tokenize, replace, join and split, etc.)</sitem></slist><p>Specifications from the EXSLT group can be found at <bibref ref="exslt"/>.</p><p>A renewed attempt to define additional function libraries using XPath 2.0 as its baseline formed
            under the name EXPath. Again, the specifications are in various states of maturity and stability, and
            implementation across popular processors is patchy. At the time of this publication the function libraries that
            exist in stable published form include:</p><slist><sitem>Binary (functions for manipulating binary data)</sitem><sitem>File Handling (reading and writing files)</sitem><sitem>Geospatial (handling of geographic data)</sitem><sitem>HTTP Client (sending HTTP requests)</sitem><sitem>ZIP Facility (reading and creating ZIP files or similar archives)</sitem></slist><p>The EXPath community has also been engaged in other related projects, such as defining packaging
            standards for distribution of XSLT/XQuery components, and tools for unit testing. Its specifications
            can be found at <bibref ref="expath"/>.</p><p>A third activity has operated under the name EXQuery, which as the name suggests has focused
            on extensions to XQuery. EXQuery has published a single specification, RestXQ, which is primarily a 
            system of function annotations allowing XQuery functions to act as endpoints for RESTful services.
            It also includes some simple functions to assist with the creation of such services. The RestXQ specification
            can be found at <bibref ref="exquery"/>.</p></div2><div2 id="functx-library" diff="add" at="E"><head>The FunctX Library</head><p>Many useful functions can be written in XSLT or XQuery, and in this case the function implementations
                  themselves can be portable across different XSLT and XQuery processors. This section describes one such library.</p><p>FunctX is an open-source library of general-purpose functions, supplied in the form of XQuery 1.0 and XSLT 2.0
               implementations. It contains over a hundred functions.

                functions themselves using XSLT 2.0 or XQuery 1.0.</p><p>This Appendix provides sample implementations of some of these functions.</p><p> To emphasize that these functions are examples of functions that vendors may write,
                their names carry the prefix 'eg'. Vendors are free to define such functions in any
                namespace. A group of vendors may also choose to create a collection of such useful
                functions and put them in a common namespace.</p><div3 id="if-empty-or-absent"><head>eg:if-empty</head><p>In some situations, users may want to provide default values for missing

	              <code>fn:collection</code> (Bug 27750).</p></item><item><p>The <code>fn:collection</code> function can now return items of any type (not only nodes).</p></item><item><p>The <code>fn:doc-available</code> function now returns false, rather than raising an error, when
	              an invalid URI is supplied (Bug 29404).</p></item><item><p>The <code>fn:collection</code> and <code>fn:uri-collection</code> functions are no longer
	              required to report a specific error when the supplied URI is invalid (Bug 29404).</p></item><item><p>The two functions <code>fn:json-to-xml</code> and <code>fn:xml-to-json</code>, previously
	              in the XSLT 3.0 specification, have been transferred to this specification (Bug 27997),
	              and minor changes have been made to <code>fn:parse-json</code> and <code>fn:json-doc</code>
	              in the interests of alignment.</p></item><item><p>The rules for functions that accept an options parameter as a map have been unified,
	              clarified, and moved into a single place (Bug 28196).</p></item><item><p>Added a suggested (optional) way of referencing CLDR numbering schemes in <code>fn:format-integer</code> (Bug 27614).</p></item><item><p>The second argument of <code>fn:serialize</code> can now be provided in the form of a map, giving serialization
	              options (Bug 28140).</p></item><item><p>The new function <code>fn:default-language</code> has been added. (Bug 28850).</p></item><item><p>The <code>fn:parse-ietf-date</code> function now accepts a single-digit hours value (Bug 29496).</p></item><item><p>Clarified that <code>array:join</code> when given an empty sequence as input produces an empty array as its result. (Bug 29607).</p></item><item><p>Provided a suggested interpretation for fragment identifiers in the URI passed to <code>fn:doc</code>. (Bug 29608).</p></item><item><p>The new function <code>array:put</code> has been added. (Bug 29685).</p></item><item><p>The function <code>fn:random-number-generator</code> now accepts an empty sequence
	              as the first argument. (Bug 29671).</p></item><item><p>The functions <code>map:remove</code> and <code>array:remove</code> can now remove
	           multiple entries/members in a single call. (Bug 29660).</p></item><item><p>The rules under which <code>fn:xml-to-json</code> recognizes map keys as duplicates, especially
	           when some characters are escaped, have been clarified. (Bug 29588)</p></item><item><p>The <code>fn:json-to-xml</code> function now escapes solidus (<code>/</code>) as
	              <code>\/</code>. (Bug 29665)</p></item><item><p>A new function <code>map:find</code> is provided to allow recursive searching of nested maps and arrays. (Bug 29743)</p></item><item><p>The options to the <code>fn:transform</code> function have been refined. (Bugs 29832 and 29939)</p></item><item><p>The serialization parameters supplied to <code>fn:transform</code> have been brought into line with those supplied
	              to <code>fn:serialize</code>. (Bugs 29940 and 29943)</p></item><item><p>To ensure that collation keys can be compared without ambiguity, the <code>fn:collation-key</code> function
	           is now defined to return an <code>xs:base64Binary</code> result. (Bug 29853)</p></item><item><p>Collation URIs for UCA collations have a new parameter <code>maxVariable</code> indicating which groups
	           of characters (for example whitespace and punctuation) should be ignored, or given reduced significance, when
	           comparing strings. In addition, most of the parameters in UCA collation URIs now have interoperable default
	           values. (Bug 29865)</p></item></olist><p>In addition, a number of technical clarifications have been made:</p><olist><item><p>Clarification of the specialized meaning of the term "primitive type" used throughout 
	              section <specref ref="casting"/> (Bug 27737).</p></item><item><p>Error conditions and handling of edge cases such as unpaired surrogates are more clearly defined
	              for JSON-related functions such as <code>fn:parse-json</code>.</p></item><item><p>The description of <code>fn:replace</code> has been changed to clarify that certain error conditions are not
	              applicable when the <code>q</code> flag is present.</p></item><item><p>The properties of the functions returned by <code>fn:random-number-generator</code>
	           have been spelt out in more detail.</p></item><item><p>The rules for the <code>fn:idref</code> function have been clarified in the edge case where a node contains both IDREF
	           and non-IDREF items in its typed value (Bug 28238).</p></item><item><p>The specification of regular expressions is now more careful to distinguish capturing parentheses in a
	              regex from other (non-capturing) parentheses.</p></item><item><p>The specification of <code>fn:collation-key</code> has been clarified to make it explicit that the function
	              follows the general rules for collation URI arguments.</p></item><item><p>The rules for handling of grouping separators in <code>fn:format-integer</code> have been spelt out in more detail.</p></item><item><p>Some rules have been added to disallow nonsensical picture strings in <code>fn:format-number</code>. Specifically,
	           the mantissa part cannot consist of a decimal separator on its own; a grouping separator cannot appear at the end of the integer part
	           of the picture; and adjacent grouping separators are disallowed.

	              <code>fn:year-from-dateTime</code> should handle negative (BCE) years.</p></item><item><p>Bug 30045: corrected an error in the specification of <code>array:fold-left</code> and <code>array:fold-right</code>
	              which suggested they should wrap the result in an array, contrary to all examples, notes, and test cases.</p></item></olist></div2><div2 id="changes-since-Jan-2017" diff="add" at="G"><head>Changes since the Proposed Recommendation of 17 January 2017</head><p>The following corrections have been made:</p><olist><item><p>Bug 29951: Shortly before publication of the Candidate Recommendation on 13 December 2016, a change to the
	           <code>fn:transform</code> function was agreed, whereby the option <code>delivery-format:saved</code> was replaced
	           by a new option <code>post-process</code> taking a callback function as its value. This change was incompletely applied:
	           (a) it was not mentioned in the change log, and (b) some explanatory notes and error conditions relating to the interpretation of
	           the option <code>delivery-format:saved</code> were not removed from the specification. These omissions have been
	           rectified.</p></item><item><p>Bug 30052: Corrected ill-formed markup in an example of the <code>fn:xml-to-json</code> function.</p></item><item><p>Bug 30053: An example showing the effect of supplying <code>fn:parse-xml-fragment</code> with ill-formed XML markup contained
	              errors other than the one being illustrated.</p></item><item><p>Bug 30069: Corrected any suggestion that XPTY0004 was the only error that could occur
	           when applying the function conversion rules to option parameters.</p></item></olist></div2></inform-div1><inform-div1 id="back-compatibility" diff="chg" at="A"><head>Compatibility with Previous Versions</head><p>This section summarizes the extent to which this specification is compatible with previous versions.</p><p diff="chg" at="C">Version 3.1 of this function library is fully backwards compatible with version 3.0, with the following caveats:</p><olist diff="add" at="C"><item><p>The return type of the result of <code>fn:min</code> and <code>fn:max</code> is more strictly prescribed
            than in earlier versions.</p></item><item><p>The behavior of functions when the static base URI is absent is more strictly prescribed than
            in earlier versions.</p></item><item><p>In the <code>fn:format-number</code> function, some picture strings that previously were permitted 
               but had no defined meaning are now disallowed.</p></item><item><p diff="add" at="D">In the <code>fn:format-number</code> function, the rules as given in XPath/XQuery 3.0, and before that in XSLT 2.0,
               resulted in the number zero being formatted as a zero-length string under certain pictures (for example <code>".#"</code>).
               This has been deemed a bug rather than a feature, and has been corrected in this version of the specification.
            </p></item><item><p>The return type of the result of <code>fn:collection</code> is now broader, which may result in errors
               when strict static typing is used.</p></item><item><p diff="add" at="E">In the <code>fn:format-time</code> and <code>fn:format-dateTime</code> functions,
            fractional seconds are now truncated towards zero rather than being rounded when necessary to fit in the 
            maximum width (previous versions of the specification prescribed rounding, but did not say what should happen
            when a fraction such as <code>0.999</code> rounded to <code>1</code>).</p></item></olist><p>For compatibility issues regarding earlier versions, see the 3.0 version of this specification.</p></inform-div1></back></spec>
