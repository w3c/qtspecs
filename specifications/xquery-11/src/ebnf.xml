      <head>Extra-grammatical Constraints</head>
      <p>This section contains constraints on the EBNF productions,
      which are required to parse legal sentences. The notes below
      are referenced from the right side of the production, with
      the notation: 
      <emph>/* xgc: &lt;id&gt; */</emph>.</p>
      <constraintnote id="parse-note-leading-lone-slash" type="xgc"
      diff="chg" at="XQ.E24 and XP.E16">
        <head>leading-lone-slash</head>
        <p>A single slash may appear either as a complete path
        expression or as the first part of a path expression in
        which it is followed by a 
        <nt def="RelativePathExpr">RelativePathExpr</nt>. In some
        cases, the next token after the slash is insufficient to
        allow a parser to distinguish these two possibilities: the 
        <code>*</code> token and keywords like 
        <code>union</code> could be either an operator or a 
        <nt def="NameTest">NameTest</nt>
        <phrase role="xquery">, and the 
        <code>&lt;</code> token could be either an operator or the
        start of a 
        <nt def="DirectConstructor">
        DirectConstructor</nt></phrase>. For example, without
        lookahead the first part of the expression 
        <code>/ * 5</code> is easily taken to be a complete
        expression, 
        <code role="parse-test">/ *</code>, which has a very different interpretation
        (the child nodes of 
        <code>/</code>).</p>
        <p>Therefore to reduce the need for lookahead, if the token
        immediately following a slash can form the start of a 
        <nt def="RelativePathExpr">RelativePathExpr</nt>, then the
        slash must be the beginning of a 
        <nt def="PathExpr">PathExpr</nt>, not the entirety of
        it.</p>
        <p>A single slash may be used as the left-hand argument of
        an operator by parenthesizing it: 
        <code role="parse-test">(/) * 5</code>. The expression 
        <code role="parse-test">5 * /</code>, on the other hand, is legal without
        parentheses.</p>
      </constraintnote>
      <constraintnote id="parse-note-xml-version" type="xgc">
        <head>xml-version</head>
        <p>An implementation's choice to support the <bibref ref="XML"
        /> and <bibref ref="XMLNAMES" />, or <bibref ref="XML1.1" />
        and <bibref ref="XMLNAMES11" /> lexical specification
        determines the external document from which to obtain the
        definition for this production. The EBNF only has references
        to the 1.0 versions. In some cases, the XML 1.0 and XML 1.1
        definitions may be exactly the same. Also please note that
        these external productions follow the whitespace rules of
        their respective specifications, and not the rules of this
        specification, in particular <specref
        ref="DefaultWhitespaceHandling" />. Thus <code>prefix :
        localname</code> is not a valid <termref
        def="dt-qname">lexical QName</termref> for purposes of this
        specification, just as it is not permitted in a XML
        document. Also, comments are not permissible on either side of
        the colon. Also extra-grammatical constraints such as
        well-formedness constraints must be taken into account.</p>
      </constraintnote>

      <constraintnote id="parse-note-reserved-function-names"
      type="xgc">
        <head>reserved-function-names</head>
        <p>Unprefixed function names spelled the same way as
        language keywords could make the language harder to
        recognize. For instance, 
        <code>if(foo)</code> could be taken either as a 
        <nt def="FunctionCall">FunctionCall</nt> or as the beginning
        of an 
        <nt def="IfExpr">IfExpr</nt>.  Therefore, an unprefixed
	function name must not be any of the names in
	<specref ref="id-reserved-fn-names" />.</p>
       
        <p>A function named "if" can be called by binding its
        namespace to a prefix and using the prefixed form:
        "library:if(foo)" instead of "if(foo)".</p>
      </constraintnote>
      <constraintnote id="parse-note-occurrence-indicators"
      type="xgc">
        <head>occurrence-indicators</head> <p>As written, the grammar
        in <specref ref="nt-bnf" /> is ambiguous for some forms using
        the '+' and '*' Kleene operators. The ambiguity is resolved as
        follows: these operators are tightly bound to the <nt
        def="SequenceType">SequenceType</nt> expression, and have
        higher precedence than other uses of these symbols.  Any
        occurrence of '+' and '*', as well as '?', following a
        sequence type is assumed to be an occurrence indicator, which
        binds to the last <nt def="ItemType">ItemType</nt> in the <nt
        def="SequenceType">SequenceType</nt>.</p>

	<p>Thus, <code role="parse-test">4 treat as item() + -
	5</code> must be interpreted as <code role="parse-test">(4
	treat as item()+) - 5</code>, taking the '+' as an
	OccurrenceIndicator and the '-' as a subtraction operator. To
	force the interpretation of "+" as an addition operator (and
	the corresponding interpretation of the "-" as a unary minus),
	parentheses may be used: the form <code role="parse-test">(4
	treat as item()) + -5</code> surrounds the <nt
	def="SequenceType">SequenceType</nt> expression with
	parentheses and leads to the desired interpretation.</p>

	<p> <code>function () as xs:string *</code>
	is interpreted as <code>function () as
	(xs:string *)</code>, not as <code>(function
	() as xs:string) *</code>.  Parentheses can be used as shown
	to force the latter interpretation.</p>

        <p>This rule has as a consequence that certain forms which
        would otherwise be legal and unambiguous are not
        recognized: in "4 treat as item() + 5", the "+" is taken as
        an 
        <nt def="OccurrenceIndicator">OccurrenceIndicator</nt>, and
        not as an operator, which means this is not a legal
        expression.</p>

    <p>
      In the "Associativity" column,
      "either"
      indicates that all the operators at that level have the associative property
      (i.e., <code>(A op B) op C</code> is equivalent to <code>A op (B op C)</code>),
      so their associativity is inconsequential.
      "NA" (not applicable)
      indicates that the EBNF does not allow
      an expression that directly contains
      multiple operators from that precedence level,
      so the question of their associativity does not arise.

    <note diff="chg" at="XQ.E26 and XP.E18">
      <p>Parentheses can be used to override the operator
      precedence in the usual way. Square brackets in an expression
      such as A[B] serve two roles: they act as an operator causing
      B to be evaluated once for each item in the value of A, and
      they act as parentheses enclosing the expression B.</p>
      <p role="xquery">Curly braces in an expression such as
      validate{E} or ordered{E} perform a similar bracketing role
      to the parentheses in a function call, but with the
      difference in most cases that E is an Expr rather than
      ExprSingle, meaning that it can use the comma operator.</p>
