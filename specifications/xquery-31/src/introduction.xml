	<p role="xquery">As increasing amounts of information are stored, exchanged, and presented using
		XML, the ability to intelligently query XML data sources becomes increasingly important. One
		of the great strengths of XML is its flexibility in representing many different kinds of
		information from diverse sources. To exploit this flexibility, an XML query language must
	provide features for retrieving and interpreting information from these diverse sources.</p>

	<p role="xquery" diff="add"  at="2016-12-05">As increasing amounts of JSON are used for lightweight data-exchange, an XML query language
	for Web data needs to handle JSON as well as XML and HTML.</p>

	<p role="xquery">XQuery is designed to meet the requirements identified by the W3C XML Query
		Working Group <bibref diff="chg" at="bug28782" ref="xquery-31-requirements"/>.<phrase diff="del" at="bug28782"> and the use cases in <bibref
			ref="UseCases"/>.</phrase> It is designed to be a language in which queries are concise and
		easily understood. It is also flexible enough to query a broad spectrum of XML information
		sources, including both databases and documents. The Query Working Group has identified a
		requirement for both a non-XML query syntax and an XML-based query syntax. XQuery is
		designed to meet the first of these requirements. XQuery is derived from an XML query
		language called Quilt <bibref ref="Quilt"/>, which in turn borrowed features from several
		other languages, including XPath 1.0 <bibref ref="xpath"/>, XQL <bibref ref="XQL"/>, XML-QL
			<bibref ref="XML-QL"/>, SQL <bibref ref="SQL"/>, and OQL <bibref ref="ODMG"/>. </p>

	<p role="xpath">The primary purpose of XPath is to address the nodes of <phrase diff="chg" at="2015-07-08">XML</phrase> trees <phrase diff="add" at="2016-12-05">and JSON trees</phrase>. 
		XPath gets its name from its use of a path notation for
		navigating through the hierarchical structure of an XML document. XPath uses a compact,
		non-XML syntax to facilitate use of XPath within URIs and XML attribute values. <phrase diff="add" at="2016-12-05">&language; adds a similar syntax for navigating JSON trees</phrase>. </p>

	<p>
		<termdef id="dt-datamodel" term="data model">&language; operates on the abstract, logical
			structure of an XML document <phrase diff="add" at="2016-12-05">or JSON object</phrase>, rather than its surface syntax. This logical structure,
			known as the <term>data model</term>, is defined in <bibref ref="xpath-datamodel-31"
			/>.</termdef>

	<p role="xpath" diff="chg" at="bug29898">
          XPath is designed to be embedded in a host language such as
          <bibref ref="xslt-30"/> or <bibref ref="xquery-31"/>.
          <termdef id="dt-host-language" term="host-language">
          A <term>host language</term> for XPath is a language or
          specification that incorporates XPath as a sublanguage and
          that defines how the static and dynamic context for
          evaluation of XPath expressions are to be
          established.</termdef>
        </p>


	<p>
          <phrase diff="chg" at="bug28782" role="xquery">XQuery 3.1 is an extension of XPath 3.1.</phrase>
          <phrase diff="chg" at="bug29898" role="xpath">XPath 3.1 is a subset of XQuery 3.1.</phrase>

 In general, any expression that is
		syntactically valid and executes successfully in both <phrase diff="chg" at="bug28782">XPath 3.1 and XQuery 3.1</phrase> will return
		the same result in both languages. There are a few exceptions to this rule: <ulist>
			<item><p>Because XQuery expands <phrase role="xquery">
						<termref def="dt-predefined-entity-reference">predefined entity
							references</termref> and <termref def="dt-character-reference">character
							references</termref>
					</phrase>
					<phrase role="xpath"> predefined entity references and character references
					</phrase> and XPath does not, expressions containing these produce different
					results in the two languages. For instance, the value of the string literal
						<code role="parse-test">"&amp;amp;"</code> is <code>&amp;</code> in XQuery,
					and <code>&amp;amp;</code> in XPath. (XPath is often embedded in other
					languages, which may expand predefined entity references or character references
					before the XPath expression is evaluated.)</p></item>
			<item><p>If XPath 1.0 compatibility mode is enabled, XPath behaves differently from
					XQuery in a number of ways, <phrase role="xpath">which are noted throughout this
						document, and listed in <specref ref="id-incompat-in-false-mode"/>.</phrase>
					<phrase role="xquery">which are discussed in <bibref ref="xpath-31"
					/>.</phrase></p></item>
		</ulist></p>

	<p>Because these languages are so closely related, their grammars and language descriptions are
		generated from a common source to ensure consistency, and the editors of these
		specifications work together closely.</p>

	<p>&language; also depends on and is closely related to the following specifications:</p>

	<p>This document specifies a grammar for &language;, using the same basic EBNF notation used in
			<bibref ref="XML"/>. Unless otherwise noted (see <specref ref="lexical-structure"/>),
		whitespace is not significant in <phrase role="xquery">queries</phrase><phrase role="xpath"
			>expressions</phrase>. Grammar productions are introduced together with the features
		that they describe, and a complete grammar is also presented in the appendix [<specref
			ref="nt-bnf"/>]. The appendix is the normative version.</p>
	<p>In the grammar productions in this document, named symbols are underlined and literal text is
		enclosed in double quotes. For example, the following productions describe the syntax of a
		static function call:</p>
	<scrap>
		<head/>
		<prodrecap ref="FunctionCall"/>
		<prodrecap ref="ArgumentList"/>
	</scrap>
	<p>The productions should be read as follows: A function call consists of an <nt
			def="EQName">EQName</nt> followed by an <nt def="ArgumentList">ArgumentList</nt>. The
		argument list consists of an opening parenthesis, an optional list of one or more arguments
		(separated by commas), and a closing parenthesis.</p>


	<p>This document normatively defines the static and dynamic semantics of &language;. In this
		document, examples and material labeled as "Note" are provided for explanatory purposes and
		are not normative.</p>


	<p>Certain aspects of language processing are described in this specification as
			<term>implementation-defined</term> or <term>implementation-dependent</term>.</p>
