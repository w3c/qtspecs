This document outlines the layout of the files in these directories and
some technical details of build process.

Updated MHK 2012-06-18 to remove some obviously out-of-date information.

Top level directories
=====================
etc ............ common data; bibliography, link summary, and common Ant scripts
lib ............ jar files for the build process
requirements ... QT requirements documents
schema ......... Schemas and DTDs for the documents in this tree
specifications . QT specification documents
style .......... Stylesheets to build the documents in this tree
test-suites .... QT test suites
use-cases ...... QT use case documents

Migration
=========

The migration from the old build tree to this new one is largely complete.
An exception is the errata process, which has not yet been migrated.

Build process
=============

These documents are all built with Ant[1] (version 1.7.0 at the time
of this writing). 

Build targets
-------------

The build script (build.xml) in each directory supports the following
targets:

"all" -- builds everything

"spec" -- builds the document

"errata" -- builds the errata

"clean" -- deletes temporary files

Some documents also support additional targets of the form "ns-*"
where "*" is the name of some namespace; for example, the XPath
Functions specification includes the target ns-xpath-functions to
build the namespace document for the XPath Functions namespace.

Technical details
=================

As much as practical, common code has been factored out of the build
scripts in each directory.

Each document's build.xml file includes two additional build scripts:

  .../etc/build-constants.xml

     This defines class paths and other constants

  .../etc/build-impl.xml

     This defines common targets

To handle cross-spec linking, the build process for each specification constructs a document in /etc 
which contains an index of all the link targets in that document. When building other documents, it is this
index which is consulted, not the base document itself.

--------

Some of the build files use Ant tasks from the contributor library. See:
    http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/

To run these, use for example:
    ant -lib ~/downloads/ant-contrib-1/ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar

Equivalently, you could add
    "-lib /path/to/ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar"
to environment variable ANT_ARGS.

Alternatively, you could put the ant-contrib-*.jar file in the 'lib' directory of your ant installation.

--------

Some of the build files may cause Ant to run out of PermGen memory. To avoid this, use for example:

export ANT_OPTS="-Xms3000m -Xmx3000m -XX:PermSize=3000m -XX:MaxPermSize=3000m"
